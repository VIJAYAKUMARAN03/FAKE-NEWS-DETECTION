       "'Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam. \\nIn the final stretch of the election, Hillary Rodham Clinton has gone to war with the FBI. \\nThe word “unprecedented” has been thrown around so often this election that it ought to be retired. But it’s still unprecedented for the nominee of a major political party to go war with the FBI. \\nBut that’s exactly what Hillary and her people have done. Coma patients just waking up now and watching an hour of CNN from their hospital beds would assume that FBI Director James Comey is Hillary’s opponent in this election. \\nThe FBI is under attack by everyone from Obama to CNN. Hillary’s people have circulated a letter attacking Comey. There are currently more media hit pieces lambasting him than targeting Trump. It wouldn’t be too surprising if the Clintons or their allies were to start running attack ads against the FBI. \\nThe FBI’s leadership is being warned that the entire left-wing establishment will form a lynch mob if they continue going after Hillary. And the FBI’s credibility is being attacked by the media and the Democrats to preemptively head off the results of the investigation of the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton. \\nThe covert struggle between FBI agents and Obama’s DOJ people has gone explosively public. \\nThe New York Times has compared Comey to J. Edgar Hoover. Its bizarre headline, “James Comey Role Recalls Hoover’s FBI, Fairly or Not” practically admits up front that it’s spouting nonsense. The Boston Globe has published a column calling for Comey’s resignation. Not to be outdone, Time has an editorial claiming that the scandal is really an attack on all women. \\nJames Carville appeared on MSNBC to remind everyone that he was still alive and insane. He accused Comey of coordinating with House Republicans and the KGB. And you thought the “vast right wing conspiracy” was a stretch. \\nCountless media stories charge Comey with violating procedure. Do you know what’s a procedural violation? Emailing classified information stored on your bathroom server. \\nSenator Harry Reid has sent Comey a letter accusing him of violating the Hatch Act. The Hatch Act is a nice idea that has as much relevance in the age of Obama as the Tenth Amendment. But the cable news spectrum quickly filled with media hacks glancing at the Wikipedia article on the Hatch Act under the table while accusing the FBI director of one of the most awkward conspiracies against Hillary ever. \\nIf James Comey is really out to hurt Hillary, he picked one hell of a strange way to do it. \\nNot too long ago Democrats were breathing a sigh of relief when he gave Hillary Clinton a pass in a prominent public statement. If he really were out to elect Trump by keeping the email scandal going, why did he trash the investigation? Was he on the payroll of House Republicans and the KGB back then and playing it coy or was it a sudden development where Vladimir Putin and Paul Ryan talked him into taking a look at Anthony Weiner’s computer? \\nEither Comey is the most cunning FBI director that ever lived or he’s just awkwardly trying to navigate a political mess that has trapped him between a DOJ leadership whose political futures are tied to Hillary’s victory and his own bureau whose apolitical agents just want to be allowed to do their jobs. \\nThe only truly mysterious thing is why Hillary and her associates decided to go to war with a respected Federal agency. Most Americans like the FBI while Hillary Clinton enjoys a 60% unfavorable rating. \\nAnd it’s an interesting question. \\nHillary’s old strategy was to lie and deny that the FBI even had a criminal investigation underway. Instead her associates insisted that it was a security review. The FBI corrected her and she shrugged it off. But the old breezy denial approach has given way to a savage assault on the FBI. \\nPretending that nothing was wrong was a bad strategy, but it was a better one that picking a fight with the FBI while lunatic Clinton associates try to claim that the FBI is really the KGB. \\nThere are two possible explanations. \\nHillary Clinton might be arrogant enough to lash out at the FBI now that she believes that victory is near. The same kind of hubris that led her to plan her victory fireworks display could lead her to declare a war on the FBI for irritating her during the final miles of her campaign. \\nBut the other explanation is that her people panicked. \\nGoing to war with the FBI is not the behavior of a smart and focused presidential campaign. It’s an act of desperation. When a presidential candidate decides that her only option is to try and destroy the credibility of the FBI, that’s not hubris, it’s fear of what the FBI might be about to reveal about her. \\nDuring the original FBI investigation, Hillary Clinton was confident that she could ride it out. And she had good reason for believing that. But that Hillary Clinton is gone. In her place is a paranoid wreck. Within a short space of time the “positive” Clinton campaign promising to unite the country has been replaced by a desperate and flailing operation that has focused all its energy on fighting the FBI. \\nThere’s only one reason for such bizarre behavior. \\nThe Clinton campaign has decided that an FBI investigation of the latest batch of emails poses a threat to its survival. And so it’s gone all in on fighting the FBI. It’s an unprecedented step born of fear. It’s hard to know whether that fear is justified. But the existence of that fear already tells us a whole lot. \\nClinton loyalists rigged the old investigation. They knew the outcome ahead of time as well as they knew the debate questions. Now suddenly they are no longer in control. And they are afraid. \\nYou can smell the fear. \\nThe FBI has wiretaps from the investigation of the Clinton Foundation. It’s finding new emails all the time. And Clintonworld panicked. The spinmeisters of Clintonworld have claimed that the email scandal is just so much smoke without fire. All that’s here is the appearance of impropriety without any of the substance. But this isn’t how you react to smoke. It’s how you respond to a fire. \\nThe misguided assault on the FBI tells us that Hillary Clinton and her allies are afraid of a revelation bigger than the fundamental illegality of her email setup. The email setup was a preemptive cover up. The Clinton campaign has panicked badly out of the belief, right or wrong, that whatever crime the illegal setup was meant to cover up is at risk of being exposed. \\nThe Clintons have weathered countless scandals over the years. Whatever they are protecting this time around is bigger than the usual corruption, bribery, sexual assaults and abuses of power that have followed them around throughout the years. This is bigger and more damaging than any of the allegations that have already come out. And they don’t want FBI investigators anywhere near it. \\nThe campaign against Comey is pure intimidation. It’s also a warning. Any senior FBI people who value their careers are being warned to stay away. The Democrats are closing ranks around their nominee against the FBI. It’s an ugly and unprecedented scene. It may also be their last stand. \\nHillary Clinton has awkwardly wound her way through numerous scandals in just this election cycle. But she’s never shown fear or desperation before. Now that has changed. Whatever she is afraid of, it lies buried in her emails with Huma Abedin. And it can bring her down like nothing else has.  '"

cherrypicked Clinton’s words claimed Clinton said “vets treated essentially fine” Clinton said problems Department Veterans Affairs “widespread” Republicans claimed went acknowledge problems including issue wait times doctors The forum sponsored NBC News Iraq Afghanistan Veterans America held Sept Intrepid Sea Air Space Museum New York City Today show host Matt Lauer members military veterans audience questioned candidates separately Trump said “was totally war Iraq” Clinton claimed supported Iraq War started The facts don’t support either candidate’s strong assertions Our review Trump’s statements Iraq War started found evidence Trump opposed war started In fact expressed mild support invading Iraq asked Howard Stern radio show Sept — six months war started Stern asked Trump supported war Iraq Trump responded “Yeah I guess so” In NBC commander chief forum Trump cited Esquire article appeared August show opposition war But article appeared months war started As Clinton senator voted October authorize war Iraq Democratic nominee claimed Trump “supported happened supported happening record supporting happened” But evidence Trump opposed Iraq War started Clinton campaign offered evidence Trump supported war “after happened” The Clinton campaign cited Trump’s interview March Neil Cavuto Fox Business two days war started Cavuto asked Trump impact war stock market Trump said war “looks like tremendous success military standpoint” predicted market “go like rocket” war But Cavuto ask Trump whether US gone war Iraq whether supports war Trump doesn’t offer opinion As early July Trump expressed concern Hardball Chris Matthews money spent Iraq rather US Two months later Trump told MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough “I guess maybe I I would fought terrorism necessarily Iraq” Clinton invited audience read Trump’s comments Iraq War They read timeline “Donald Trump Iraq War” Trump said President Obama set “certain date” withdrawing troops Iraq date actually set President George W Bush NBC’s Matt Lauer asked Trump tendency respond pushed details military proposals he’s going give details wants “unpredictable” Trump responded “Absolutely” went criticize Obama revealing withdrawal date As said Republicans Democrats disagree whether Obama Bush blame withdrawing combat troops Iraq end But date set Bush signed Status Forces Agreement Dec It said “All United States Forces shall withdraw Iraqi territory later December ” In NBC forum Trump also called withdrawal troops “a terrible decision” As we’ve explained Condoleezza Rice Bush’s secretary State later wrote Bush wanted agreement residual force remain Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri alMaliki objected Once Obama took office January three years renegotiate deal administration tried leave residual American troop force But Maliki still didn’t agree Negotiations broke October issue whether US troops would shielded criminal prosecution Iraqi authorities Whether Obama enough matter opinion His defense secretary Leon Panetta later wrote president didn’t press hard enough deal But experts say Iraq closely aligned time Iran wasn’t deal made Maliki So presidents role withdrawal troops But Trump wrongly said Obama one set “certain date” withdrawal let US enemies know date set Obama sworn It’s worth noting Trump said March interview CNN troops withdrawn quickly Iraq Trump said Obama’s visits China Saudi Arabia Cuba “the first time history storied history Air Force One” “high officials” host country appear greet president That’s true Other presidents encountered similar lowkey greetings foreign trips aboard presidential aircraft Trump referred fact Cuba’s president Raul Castro greet Obama airport historic visit Cuba March Saudi Arabia’s King Salman meet Air Force One start Obama’s trip Riyadh April referred China’s handling president’s arrival Hangzhou last Saturday Group meeting Whether arrivals constituted snubs US president Trump claims matter debate But Trump wrong facts

referring Clinton’s claim supports privatization Trump’s campaign published “The Goals Of Donald J Trump’s Veterans Plan” website last October It doesn’t call VA completely privatized One biggest changes plan would make current VA health care system allowing veterans get care nonVA medical center accepts Medicare “Under Trump Administration veterans eligible VA health care bring veteran’s ID card doctor care facility accepts Medicare get care need immediately” plan states “The power choose stop wait time backlogs force VA improve compete department wants keep receiving veterans’ healthcare dollars” plan says Trump’s proposal would seemingly go NonVA Medical Care Program allows eligible veterans access care outside VA certain circumstances VA medical centers cannot provide services The program requires preapproval veterans receive care nonVA facility nonemergency situations Trump’s proposal would also go bipartisan Veterans Choice Act President Obama signed law creating temporary program separate NonVA Medical Care Program allows eligible veterans receive health care nonVA facility would wait days appointment VA medical center live miles nearest VA hospital Trump stuck idea allowing veterans choose public private hospitals released recent “Ten Point Plan To Reform The VA” July Point plan says “Mr Trump ensure every veteran choice seek care VA private service provider choice Under Trump Administration veteran die waiting service” Trump reinforced part plan NBC News forum well To clear Trump supports giving veterans choice VA hospitals private ones That’s thing supporting complete privatization system provides care veterans Trump criticized Clinton making “a terrible mistake Libya” secretary State But time Trump also supported US action led removal Moammar Gadhafi power Trump made claim response question posed Lauer whether Trump “prepared Day One” elected president tackle “complex national security issues” This isn’t first time Trump ignored past support US intervention Libya During th GOP debate Trump said “never discussed subject” Sen Ted Cruz called supporting US action country But wrote Trump said US go Libya “on humanitarian basis” “knock Gadhafi quickly surgically effectively save lives” Trump made comment video posted YouTube channel February Even though Trump says Clinton’s support intervention Libya “terrible mistake”

propose something radical problems VA seem intractable” Maddow said Maddow asked Clinton “new ideas trying fix” VA Here Clinton’s response part Trump referring bold Clinton accused Republicans underfunding VA “want fail” privatize Clinton added “But creative trying fix problems legitimate concern try stymie Republican assault” Indeed Clinton campaign website states Clinton wants “fundamentally reform veterans’ health care ensure access timely high quality care” The campaign says Clinton “was outraged recent scandals VA president demand accountability performance VA leadership” The site specifically mentions Clinton’s dissatisfaction “many veterans wait unacceptably long time see doctor process disability claims appeals” promises “build stcentury Department

economies headed women German Chancellor Angela Merkel But numbers “firsts” invite deeper question Do women really lead differently From halls government corporate boardrooms it’s burning question “I think we’re good listeners I think helps” says Ayotte interview “I don’t want say male colleagues aren’t plenty But I think listen we’re picking see common ground people” On point bipartisan agreement “There good research shows women tend different leadership styles” Democratic Sen Jeanne Shaheen New Hampshire’s senator says interview “We tend inclusive we’re less autocratic decisionmaking We like consensus like get people around table I think made difference” Of course there’s also example Rep Nancy Pelosi D California first woman speaker House During tenure known ability wield power – highly

anybody ever expected sizable number Democrat voters share view politics rigged game billionaires crony capitalists always win And like Sanders sick tired If briefly scroll back top article look graph polarization time youll see previous peak around While historical analogies never perfect notable similarities around For one last time sitting speaker US House effectively challenged within party Second Republican Party divided presidential nomination party splintered half Republicans supporting Howard Taft incumbent half supporting Teddy Roosevelt previous incumbent Democrat Woodrow Wilson landslide Around also last great antiestablishment movement America progressive movement emerged response growing concentrations wealth political power concentrations many Americans felt left behind As political scientist Grant McConnell wrote progressive legacy consisted charges made virtually institutions American society one common theme — corruption Corruption prevalence disorder magnitude could explained something assumption slowspreading decay The theory conspiracy ready hand one way another invoked explanation This resonates todays antiestablishment mood Political scientist Hans Noel argued emergence progressive movement crosscut parties eventually reshaped Noel notes progressives opposed existing authority structures economically eg trusts politically disliked political parties authority structures In progressive Republican George Norris led internal House revolt Speaker Joe Cannon stripping Cannon authority devolving considerable powers back individual members increasingly chafed marginalization Like John Boehner Cannon represented culmination exactly years increasingly centralized leadership control House speakership Just Gingrich radically centralized control Speaker Thomas Reed radically centralized control Parties depolarized s s freed centralized leadership structures legislating happened committees crosscutting progressive coalition could freely operate independently two parties Interestingly trade policy also became much less polarized s crossparty coalitions tariff issues Most likely Trump Republican nominee Even NeverTrump forces somehow wrest nomination unlikely possible antiestablishment forces Republican Party going away If Trump though guess stick around longer somebody Tea Party possibly even Ted Cruz find way harness Trump voters following Trump issues playbook Where voters politicians Meanwhile Congress House Speaker Paul Ryan already difficulty building consensus around budget process No matter many speeches gives importance decorum politics seems increasingly unlikely reconcile conflicts Boehner failed resolve means eventually lean Democrats pass budget like Boehner alienate party Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell much less beloved even within party face similar problems Most likely Hillary Clinton become th US president led every single headtohead poll Trump And likely use agendasetting powers try force Republicans open civil war pushing many issues already divide especially immigration trade Clintons natural home probusiness center position advantageous Democrats short term least But cautious Emboldened Sanders Elizabeth Warren progressive wing Democrats growing unhappy Clintons probusiness instincts The internal fights continue parties The competing wings parties feel true RepublicansDemocrats The growing importance outside nonparty groups elections also force ideological diversity onto parties Party leaders might instinctually want wrest power back outside groups theyd wiser open tent allow different ideas After party best American politics always one build broadest coalition means accepting ideological diversity Eventually congressional leaders realize forced realize leadership style works less centralized committeedriven approach This way ideologically heterogeneous parties effectively govern A decentralized Congress fluid coalitions function better assuming committeedriven process also accompanied increases congressional staffing capacity Partisan control Congress mean less since crossparty coalitions Many issues like gun rights affirmative action remain partisan But issues especially corporateWall Street power antitrust interventionist foreign policy likely split parties Trump Republicans Sanders Democrats find common cause establishment centrists Big organized interests like Chamber Commerce corporate groups align less closely Republicans realizing future success require right mix Republicans Democrats advance agendas And parties become ideological diverse voters generally ideologically place current party alignment would suggest identify less reliably one since parties They sometimes split tickets depending running Many feel passionate individual issues align supporters issues parties especially individual interest groups become crosspartisan order achieve policy outcomes In respect politics come look like s s liberal Republicans existed alongside conservative Democrats This optimistic scenario But works party leaders tolerate diversity within party allow disagreements Another scenario establishment Republicans banish Trump faction Democrats banish Sanders faction elections parties go back predictable intractable trench warfare battle lines become increasingly dug past two decades using nastier nastier tactics subvert internal divisions service larger fight common enemy This may possible little longer especially economy improves significantly still probably longterm unsustainable reasons Ive described It also may mean becomes even violent nasty election Another possibility parties realign quickly TrumpTea Party faction effecting rapid transformation Republican Party downscale nationalist populist party pushing remaining upperclass moderate Republicans probusiness Democratic Party turn pushes disaffected Sanders voters Republican Party If realignment happens quickly period depolarization But seems unlikely given stickiness partisan identity strong disagreements two parties whole range issues Other scenarios possible well especially significant global crises But heres bottom line Something different year American politics The logic operated past two decades breaking largely factors trends propelled produced unsustainable contradictions American

swing state Colorado Stein In Las Vegas asked repeatedly vote thirdparty candidate somehow wasted “A wasted vote voting somebody don’t believe That’s wasted vote” Johnson said “Vote person believe – that’s bring change I hope made pitch today you’ll realize want waste vote Clinton Trump it” Stein spoke separately event similarly argued many Americans looking alternative Trump Hillary Clinton dubbed “the disliked untrusted” majorparty nominees US history “Democracy needs moral compass” told gathering Asian American Pacific Island groups “It’s don’t like afraid of” Stein like Johnson represented party outlined policy positions include “Green New Deal” focused renewable energy jobs aimed making United States transition renewable energy complete Stein also proposed reduction military budget third creation regional food systems based sustainable organic agriculture On Republican side Evan McMullin beneficiary grounded “Never Trump” movement failed get ballot states he’d even sent first campaign release McMullin nonetheless tried give disaffected conservatives alternative Republican nominee says tapped “people’s darkest prejudices deepest fears” McMullin’s best hope – likely one – make electoral dent would require Trump’s departure race though nominee made overt sign wants quit “Like millions Americans I hoped year would bring us better nominees despite party differences could offer compelling visions better future” McMullin said announcement “Instead left two candidates fundamentally unfit profound responsibilities seek” But begin make difference Only recent election cycles third party candidates significant influence Texan businessman Ross Perot took vote carving support incumbent Republican George HW Bush helping Arkansas governor Bill Clinton victory Some Democrats blamed thirdparty candidate Ralph Nader delivering George W Bush election thirdparty candidate paltry vote supporters split Republicans Democrats Johnson’s running mate former Massachusetts governor William Weld said he’d seen interest fundraising pick Trump’s campaign floundered Their campaign recently reported m oneweek fundraising haul reported people pledged donate least campaign August But relatively tight race With Clinton leading Trump double digits key battleground states impact thirdparty candidate could limited “At moment doesn’t look like much impact all” said Hank Sheinkopf veteran Democratic adviser “But race gets closer could throw either way” Sheinkopf reasoned election become personalities less party leaders want The longterm impact may significant shift people view Democrats Republicans said As stands Stein Johnson McMullin could act convenient parking spot voters disgusted candidates Earlier month federal judge rejected challenge brought Johnson Stein arguing bar inclusion set artificially high Yet signs ground could shifting Mike McCurry cochair Commission Presidential Debates former press secretary Bill Clinton hinted third podium might needed “Some production people may said ‘Just case need plan might look like’’ McCurry told Politico “We won’t know number invitations extend midSeptember” Ron Faucheux president Clarus Research Group nonpartisan polling company said broad support including even minor candidates “Polls show voters think third party candidates included” said “and election like polls show majority voters dislike main party candidates good reason give opportunity least look options” But even Johnson Stein somewhat wistful prospects casting agents change best could represent beginning break current twoparty system “The biggest message ‘consider us’ viable alternative twoparty system become polarized they’re able anything” Johnson said Stein advanced similar argument “We’re political reorganization election Republicans kind falling apart” said “and Democrats kind split lot Bernie Sanders supporters happy alternative” She argued elections “the lesser two evils” country inherited many problems But first two get TV “There’s way I’m going win presidency I’m presidential debates” Johnson said “I believe anything possible given right arguably two polarizing figures American

slightly different ways though handicaps must overcome win Bush repeatedly pushed back Trump arguing anger insults cannot win presidency He seeks aspirational candidate conservative enough record Florida acceptable conservative party offering positive inclusive message reaches beyond GOP coalition But many Republicans see Bush least able appeal across entire party — much able appeal hard right

This week Trump unveiled details new economic plan mainstream media field day criticizing But truth simply cannot afford stay path Barack Obama Hillary Clinton Democrats us right Millions jobs shipped country middle class dying poverty exploding millions children America don’t enough food reckless spending created biggest debt bubble history planet Something must done else continue steamroll toward economic oblivion So Donald Trump man hour If would like read full economic plan find official campaign website His plan starts pointing weakest “economic recovery” since Great Depression… Last week’s GDP report showed economy grew mere second quarter last year It’s weakest recovery since Great Depression – predictable consequence massive taxation regulation oneside trade deals onerous energy restrictions And Trump exactly right weak economic recovery So would fix things The following things every American know Donald Trump’s plan save US economy… Donald Trump would lower taxes middle class The tax savings Trump’s plan would actually quite substantial middle class families The following numbers come recent Charisma article … • A married couple earning per year two children child care expenses save current tax bill • A married couple earning per year two children child care expenses receive reduction tax bill • Married couple earning million per year two children child care expenses get reduction tax bill Donald Trump would lower taxes businesses Under plan business America would taxed percent Alternatively Hillary Clinton’s plan would tax small businesses rate close percent So Trump’s plan would undoubtedly good businesses would encourage many left country return But would lost tax revenue made Childcare expenses would exempt taxation For working families children would great blessing Without doubt effort win working women demographic Trump struggling It definitely idea I support money come pay US manufacturers allowed immediately fully expense new plants equipment This would undoubtedly lead boom capital investment would also reduce tax revenue As emergency measure would good encouraging manufacturers stay America would also likely increase budget deficit A temporary freeze new regulations Red tape one big pet peeves I greatly applaud Trump proposal I think Bob Eschliman put well wrote following Trump’s planned freeze new regulations… In alone federal agencies issued final rules regulations prior year Studies show small manufacturers face three times burden average US business hidden tax ineffective regulations amounts “nearly per US household” annually Excessive regulation costing country much trillion dollars per year Trump end All existing regulations would reviewed unnecessary regulations would eliminated In particular Trump’s plan would focus getting rid regulations inhibit hiring The following specific areas identifies official campaign website … The Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Power Plan forces investment renewable energy expense coal natural gas raising electricity rates The EPA’s Waters United States rule gives EPA ability regulate smallest streams private land limiting land use The Department Interior’s moratorium coal mining permits put tens thousands coal miners work Donald Trump would fundamentally alter trade relationships rest globe Donald Trump first major party nominee decades recognize trade deficit absolutely killing economy I write time hot button issue So I definitely applaud Trump proposing following … Appoint trade negotiators whose goal win America narrowing trade deficit increasing domestic production getting fair deal workers Renegotiate NAFTA Bring trade relief cases world trade organization Label China currency manipulator Apply tariffs duties countries cheat Direct Commerce Department use legal tools respond trade violations Donald Trump’s plan would tremendous boost US energy industry Barack Obama promised kill coal industry one promises actually kept Obama also killed Keystone Pipeline right energy industry whole enduring worst stretch since last recession To turn things around Trump would following … Rescind jobdestroying Obama executive actions including Climate Action Plan Waters US rule Save coal industry industries threatened Hillary Clinton’s extremist agenda Ask Trans Canada renew permit application Keystone Pipeline Make land Outer Continental Shelf available produce oil natural gas Cancel Paris Climate Agreement limit global warming degrees Celsius stop payments US tax dollars UN global warming programs Trump would repeal Obamacare Trump claims Obamacare would cost economy two million jobs next ten years And without doubt already cost US economy lot jobs Not Obamacare also sent health insurance premiums soaring putting tremendous amount financial pressure many families Trump says would “replace” Obamacare rather vague statement What exactly would replace Trump’s plan says nothing Federal Reserve This great concern Federal Reserve far power economy anyone else It heart debtbased system unless something done Fed debt bubble continue get even larger Since Federal Reserve created value US dollar fallen percent national debt gotten times larger For Trump even mention Federal Reserve economic plan tremendous oversight We midst longterm economic decline things gotten better Obama years If believe study released Harvard even acknowledges … America’s economic performance peaked late s erosion crucial economic indicators rate economic growth productivity growth job growth investment began well Great Recession Workforce participation proportion Americans productive workforce peaked With fewer workingage men women workforce percapita income US reduced Median real household income declined since incomes stagnating across virtually income levels Despite welcome jump median household income remains peak attained years ago Moreover stagnating income limited job prospects disproportionately affected lowerincome lowerskilled Americans leading inequality rise That study found percentage Americans participating labor force peaked back steadily declining since time… If continue things continue get results Donald Trump promising change many proposals sound good also areas concerned Ultimately tinkering tax code reducing regulations going enough turn US economy around We need

       " 'Given Congress become utterly dysfunctional recent years tempting think upcoming presidential election fairly lowstakes Does even matter Jeb Bush thinks tax policy Hillary Clinton proposing paid leave Hardly anything pass The next president wont need Congress tackle global warming But global warming rather different story Whoever gets elected White House enormous amount influence America’s climate policies — wont need Congress act For thank blame President Obama Over past six years Environmental Protection Agency acquired unprecedented authority regulate nation’s carbon dioxide emissions Obama used power enact slew new pollution rules including CO regulations coal plants aim cutting US greenhouse gas emissions least percent The EPA likely keep authority regulate carbon dioxide foreseeable future — unless gets altered courts repealed Congress And many biggest decisions use left next president If say Hillary Clinton wanted expand Obama’s carbon rules oil refineries cement plants could Conversely Republican president skeptical climate change wanted bog implementation Obama’s CO rules coal plants hed able Though well see Republicans may unlimited power scuttle Obamas climate policies Any future administration lot room either ambitious less ambitious explains Michael Wara expert energy environmental law Stanford And next president uses EPA could ripple effects around world — even decide fate ongoing international climate talks China India countries So far candidates vague way theyd steer EPA Clinton said Obamas climate rules protected cost shes given little sign whether might expand Meanwhile Republicans like Marco Rubio Jeb Bush sound skeptical tackling global warming havent said whether might try relax even dismantle Obamas climate policies So heres look could First recap executive branch acquired much power US climate policy Back Supreme Court ruled EPA must regulate greenhouse gases pollutants existing Clean Air Act — theres evidence endanger public health welfare In Obamas EPA laid evidence endangerment finding set motion series rules curtail US greenhouse gas emissions Since done auspices Clean Air Act law Congress passed new legislation required The EPA could act The big actions far Add White House claims rules put US pace reduce greenhouse gas emissions least percent But whether actually happens depend next president Okay lets assume Theres new president Congress still totally gridlocked climate change What happens next The next president likely wont able dismantle Obamas climate policies entirely — After Supreme Court effectively ordered EPA regulate greenhouse gases long theres evidence cause harm evidence quite solid Only Congress could undo everything Obamas done revising Clean Air Act Still whoever occupies White House EPA lot say implement Obamas climate rules That sounds boring actually key step Theres tons leeway strengthen weaken rules Here ways could play Fueleconomy standards could tightened weakened Remember EPAs fueleconomy standards new cars light trucks pace rise current miles per gallon miles per gallon Automakers may push relax CAFE standards midterm review Yet numbers arent set stone These CAFE corporate average fuel economy rules scheduled come midterm review At point automakers may lobby allow standards rise slowly — particularly sales fuelefficient vehicles sluggish due low oil prices Green groups meanwhile could push make standards stricter keep increasing past push vehicle emissions even So next administration decide Leave vehicle standards alone Make stricter Weaker The one twist due longstanding quirk Clean Air Act California threaten create stricter standards happy federal government states join Automakers really hate idea multiple sets vehicle standards around country may prefer weaken federal rules much risk California go alone The Clean Power Plan live die based implementation The EPA finalize rules reducing carbon dioxide existing power plants summer Its core component Obamas climate policy — power plants responsible percent nations greenhouse gas emissions But next president enormous influence plan actually works Assuming rule holds court could prove difficult next president simply hit kill switch plan start But get decide implement — thats arguably significant After rule finalized states another months submit plans cutting emissions though request extensions That process could drag Theres lot latitude review process At point EPA review states plans reducing emissions power plants decide whether plans acceptable An administration really wants tackle climate change make sure states much feasible By contrast president less concerned global warming could allow states wanted like Texas submit lessaggressive plans There’s lot latitude review process says Stanfords Michael Wara The history Clean Air Act shows If president doesn’t like climate policy could basically signal states they’re going give lot compliance flexibility allow states make assumptions plan reduce costs This would likely involve seemingly arcane tweaks models baselines would harder green groups challenge court Meanwhile states may outright refuse submit plans reducing emissions Sen Mitch McConnell RKY already urging states exactly If happens EPA authority impose federal plan states The agency unveil details federal plan though implementation would left next president Meanwhile industry groups almost certain challenge aspects rule court Adele Morris policy director Climate Energy Economics Project Brookings Institution points administration hostile Obamas EPA rule could defend weakly court And parts rule get struck next administration get decide redo It comes preference If administration thats friendly Obamas policy youd continuity implementation says David Doniger director Natural Resources Defense Councils climate clear air program But administration wasnt friendly could try drag feet change rules The next president decide whether regulate sectors — like refineries The Clean Air Act doesnt cover vehicles power plants Technically EPA authority regulate carbon dioxide sources well Oil refineries Cement plants Trucks Airplanes The agency regulating methane leaks new oil gas wells hasnt touched existing wells And These sources add The Obama administration leaving decisions sectors next president If Hillary Clinton comes wants expand EPAs authority If Marco Rubio comes doesnt may fend lawsuits likely hold long time At point hazy sense US presidential candidates think global warming But given much power disposal give detailed answers For instance Hillary Clintons campaign chair John Podesta claims shell put climate change clean energy top agenda And Clinton said EPAs climate rules protected cost Hillary says EPA rules protected — would expand Fine So know shell veto attempts congressional Republicans repeal EPA rules altogether But else Would try strengthen fueleconomy rules midterm review Would want expand EPAs carbon regulations oil refineries chemical plants Would try beat Obamas goal cutting emissions least percent On end spectrum theres Marco Rubio says I believe human activity causing dramatic changes climate way scientists portraying But mean practice Would weaken vehicle rules Abandon US goal cutting emissions percent Then theres Jeb Bush says hes concerned climate change need work rest world negotiate way reduce carbon emissions But mean Would keep Obamas climate rules place Strengthen Weaken Some green groups started focus questions We definitely want ensure next president actually committed building progress Clean Power Plan Tiernan Sittenfield senior vice president League Conservation Voters told For many environmentalists mainly pressing Clinton thinks Keystone XL pipeline Yet issue probably resolved Obama leaves office The EPA rules far relevant next administration Its worth precise EPA cant The executive branch acquired sweeping authority nations greenhouse gas emissions The Obama administration estimates authority alone could push emissions percent truly drastic changes energy system would likely require Congress Looked one way thats huge deal — decisive break past emissions would go seemingly without end Looked another way pittance To help avoid drastic global warming United States probably need push emissions percent midcentury That would require truly staggering changes It wouldnt enough coal gas plants get slightly efficient EPA rules Wed replace virtually entire energy system new cleaner one Thats sort thing Congress really Only Congress fund RD new technologies offer subsidies clean energy Only Congress bring dramatic changes grid infrastructure Only Congress enact economywide carbon tax Barring creative flexibility regulations things next president cant accomplish without cooperation House Senate Where EPA rules could important effect international stage — least near term Remember United States accounts percent worldwide greenhouse gas emissions Theres also China India Brazil Europe Russia Thats international cooperation climate change crucial Right world groping toward weak international agreement The US put forward pledge cut emissions least percent That spurred China respond vowing get emissions peak around Other countries started pitch Add pledges still close tackling global warming The Climate Action Tracker estimates pace global average temperatures rise °C °F preindustrial levels give take — seriously disruptive change What US done China big step changing dynamics Even experts think even weak promises could lead iteratively stronger action time You see plans could start connect together create positive negotiating dynamic David Victor political scientist UC San Diegos School International Relations Pacific Studies told The encouraging precedent trade You build credibility trust time move bigger issues The next US president help decide agreement continues evolve years come The US keep pushing emissions try persuade countries like China India respond kind Or could abandon budding framework entirely Abandoning US climate targets says Wara would real damage whatever credibility US left international stage What Obama done China big step changing dynamics positive way And US walk away would damaging future climate negotiations commitments',\n",

       " 'Only Making Matters Worse Syria October Exclusive Washington’s foreign policy establishment determined escalate US military attacks Syria even though won’t resolve conflict get people killed dilemma addressed Daniel Lazare By Daniel Lazare Middle East policy reached inflexion point moment Official Washington seems caught middle escalation retreat On one hand rhetoric militant since Hillary Clinton’s famous “we came saw died” moment October With Barack Obama halfway door Clinton crowned Washington’s laptop bombardiers rejoicing halfmeasures judgment day nearly hand Samantha Power Permanent Representative United States UN addresses Security Council meeting Syria Sept Power advocate escalating US military involvement Syria UN Photo Thus The New York Times assures us Middle East “desperate American leadership” Washington Post reports “the Republicans Democrats make foreign policy elite laying ground work assertive American foreign policy” Leading think tanks publishing “a flurry reports” urging steppedup intervention including USbacked “safe zones protect moderate rebels Syrian Russian forces” even “limited” cruisemissile strikes But differing details agree something must done The time act As Vox puts “The hot new policy idea Washington hottest old idea direct US military intervention Syria’s civil war” But reading lines different picture emerges realization US painted corner little Thus Times observes Middle East clamoring US leadership clamoring Bushstyle intervention mythical “middle ground” Obama While reporting proescalation sentiment unanimous Washington’s vast foreignpolicy establishment – sometimes known “ blob ” – Washington Post notes “even pinprick cruisemissile strikes designed hobble Syrian air force punish President Bashar alAssad would risk direct confrontation Russian forces” wonders whether warweary public support intervention “My concern may talking agreeing other” quotes one expert saying “but discussions isolated public may right now” Official Washington Bubble Thus even Establishment worries lives bubble Washington wants war needs war yet admits practically breath can’t So A heartrending propaganda image designed justify major US military operation inside Syria Syrian military Then mild liberals Vox hip successful Washington website founded journalistic wunderkind Ezra Klein Voxers pride sharp practical yet end sealed well The poster boy tendency Zack Beauchamp young writer stars recent Vox video entitled “ The crisis Aleppo explained minutes ” As Beauchamp lectures away amid fancy graphics cool background music video faithfully toes Washington line stirring gungho part downbeat refrain inevitably follows Thus describes Syrian civil war “story flipflops” Assad seemingly ropes Iran Russia put back feet point Saudis Qataris put rebels back feet game continue But real turning point says occurred September Russia stepped airstrikes allowed government besiege Salafists eastern Aleppo “A siege” Beauchamp explains “involves trapping group people civilians fighters inside certain territory denying supplies longer fight Assad’s strategy vicious logic When deprive people food bomb they’re likely give make fighting stop” The upshot says “a humanitarian crisis … roughly people trapped city … running dangerously low supplies access clean water medicine” So US response The video’s tone point turns pessimistic pitch black “The United States military power break siege Aleppo” Beauchamp says “but would extremely dangerous For one thing would need coordinate rebels ground extremists For another means US would operating hostile air space Russian planesIf US engage Russian planes could theoretically mean direct fire two nucleararmed superpowers risk people United States willing take And three even US temporarily break siege would maintain commitment insure things didn’t get worse That could mean openended war And there’s guarantee would make anything better rather might get people killed long run” So US options zero “Every diplomatic solution tried far failed failed miserably there’s simply economic tool used end fighting ease suffering people inside besieged territories There’s good answer There’s nothing anyone could simply solve crisis It’s disaster disaster without end sight” Falsehoods Obfuscations Beauchamp’s explanation – really explanation merely assertion – studded falsehoods obfuscations By describing Assad’s strategy uniquely “vicious” ignores obvious parallels Russian air campaign Aleppo US air assaults Fallujah Tikrit Ramadi central Iraq largely destroyed course “liberating” ISIS USbacked Syrian “moderate” rebels smile prepare behead yearold boy left whose severed head held aloft triumphantly later part video Screenshot YouTube video By referring events Syria civil war fails acknowledge degree actually foreign invasion US Turkey Saudi Arabia Persian Gulf states By repeatedly referring Salafists “rebels” – suggests Syrians rising within – ignores fact large numbers – according Director National Intelligence James Clapper – foreignborn While asserting people trapped inside east Aleppo ignores reports real figure far lower The Guardian ’s Martin Chulov example estimated March people remained rebelheld areas Vice News reported last July “most Aleppo’s residents fled city There handful civilians rebel fighters holding shattered ruins” Beauchamp also implies government “trapped” people east Aleppo reports London Independent elsewhere indicate Salafists firing anyone trying take government offer safe passage While acknowledging “some” fighters “extremists” ignores fact US military admitted Al Nusra local branch Al Qaeda firmly charge When Salafists launched shortlived offensive east Aleppo last summer instance The New York Times reported named honor Ibrahim alYousef Muslim Brotherhood member led horrendous massacre Alawite military cadets It indicative antiAlawite sectarianism bloodthirsty sort common denominator underlying antigovernment factions One could go point clear The foreignpolicy establishment cut public help sympathetic media outlets like Vox cut intellectual history Incapable examining US role Syrian debacle honest straightforward way blunder dark staggering backward forward circumstances dictate Now seems moment poised two So United States respond Washington preparing transition Obamastyle abstention Hillarystyle neoconservatism Here’s one reporter’s modest attempt reading tea leaves Washington continue fume catastrophe deepens Syria Iraq As drive push ISIS also known ISIL Islamic State Daesh Mosul northern Iraq degenerates ethnosectarian warfare among Turks Sunni Arabs Shi‘ites Kurds drive take back Raqqa ISIS’s capital northcentral Syria similarly falter fighting

brings Hillary Clinton familys political empire At least way Republicans media common interest I understand dynamics well cowritten book demonstrated Bill Hillary Clinton used Hillarys time State build family political operation set fourth presidential campaign That say Ive done lot research Clintons relationship media experienced firsthand As author I felt I owed reader report investigate write mix curiosity skepticism rigor compassion I would use subject I wanted sell books course But easier way — proven time — write though Clintons purest form evil The holds daily reporting Want drive traffic website Write something nasty Clinton particularly Hillary As reporter I get sucked playing Clinton rules This Ive seen colleagues One former colleagues hardnosed reporter put countless political pelts wall told everyone public life something hide Who goes flames scandal The politicians decide go That may percent true true enough The act choosing time go person effect tainting person even investigation reporting turns nothing nefarious — time spent digging adversaries The original source alleged malfeasance could come party within politicians party reporters observations industrious digging But two things crystal clear If theres investigation theres scandal And theres scandal theres scalp The Clintons investigation years Theres little doubt theyve produced information investigators lawyers journalists finances business philanthropic dealings decisionmaking processes government officials American history Theyve watched countless friends frogmarched congressional hearings cases jail They know theres good chance expressed thought become part public record twisted political gain The absurd allegations Hillary Clinton bookends public career far something suicide Clinton White House aide Vince Foster bears responsibility terrorist attack killed US Ambassador Libya Chris Stevens But Travelgate Filegate Whitewater Some less legitimate others When Clinton surprisingly claimed husband dead broke left White House spent money defend eightyear barrage investigations Its understandable Clintons bunker mentality comes transparency But paranoia leads secretive secrecy leads Republicans press suspect wrongdoing That spurs investigation makes Clintons secretive The paranoia persistent investigation feed endless cycle probe parry Along way political class public forced choose imperfect sides power couple always seems hiding something Washington investigation complex overly partisan underwhelming ability prove gross misconduct This Republicans reasonable strategy They know keep investigating two things keep media writing scandals might knock turn voters dont want return bloodsport politics s They leak partial stories reporters hungry one

journalists absolutely sure already gone secret nuptials And serious note remember Benghazi flu Many political opponents members media unable accept idea Clinton forced cancel planned Senate testimony Benghazi shed suffered concussion Now three years later seems ridiculous think Clinton making excuse — shes since testified sides Hill — suffered Karl Rove suggested brain damage And making concussion avoid testifying suffer brain damage fake fall The conservative media echo chamber bounces innuendo Rush Limbaugh Fox News back ensures damning story lines — true — stay alive The Benghazi attacks perfect example Terrorists killed four Americans The conservative echo chamber seems convinced Hillary Clinton fault The reasonable argument make shouldnt Libya first place murders downthechain result

evidence Clinton aware requests standdown order prevented reinforcements arriving Benghazi never mind wouldnt gotten fighting done even House Republican committee found order absurd Clinton knew attack coming This Limbaugh put May The freedom conservative media make wild allegations often acts bulldozer forcing reporters check charges repeat By time theyve debunked theyre part American publics collective consciousness Or said lie gets around world truth gets bed One outgrowth Clintons terrible relationship reporters journalists often assume acting bad faith Theres good reason Though shes added new pros press staff campaign operations stance toward media always reflection way Bill Clintons White House handled journalists Back mids Bill Clinton relied series Machiavellian spin doctors keep press bay With Clinton White House modus operandi stonewall long possible lie necessary — habit — turn questions around questioners After Bill Clinton wagged finger press conference told

Clintons attitudes toward press evidence Clintons hiding something That attitude carried Hillary Clintons campaign degree tenure Secretary State The standard response reporters question answer It

aides used rope create impromptu moving barrier reporters keeping away candidate voters She treated like cattle responded putting video television last three days The mistrust among journalists problem Clinton And media amplifier public also little wonder many voters inclined believe shes often acting bad faith Most Americans say shes honest trustworthy This view shared many reporters public makes much easier treat Clintons actions though uniquely sinister Case point She made ton money giving paid speeches people business government So Jeb Bush course But Bush recently released accounting speeches media little interest dealings Kudos Ken Vogel Politico digging story published Thursday The imbalance assumptions Clintons motivations another way Clinton code distorting effect public perception And selfperpetuating It leads Clinton assume press biased leads treat press poorly leads reporters assume shes trying hide something When Clinton keynoted annual fundraiser David Axelrods

Chipotle became first viral image campaign Reporters gave fodder latenight comedians earlier year made mad dash catch campaign van rolled This coverage every last detail course isnt oneway street It wasnt reporter tipped Chipotle visit anyone knew She craves attention even detests But distorting effect As royal family London normally private moments become part public narrative husbands affair daughters wedding birth granddaughter All attention effect making Clinton seem casual observer hungrier press even average politician And theres doubt part lovehate relationship intense desire attract manipulate coverage But Clinton understands sometimes better spotlight The best example declined requests appear Sunday political talk shows right Benghazi attacks Susan Rice ambassador UN Obamas

fascination Clintons coverage would whether Hillary Clinton wanted For someone lost big lead presidential primary ceding ground Bernie Sanders right Clinton given lot credit political acumen Her detractors see every move including birth granddaughter grandly conceived executed political calculation And Clinton plays using positives life political gain That doesnt make different candidates presidency — makes like New Jersey Gov Chris Christie talked grandmothers mom wife kids launched bid presidency last week Was calculated send messages Christie public Of course The best example though tear — one rolled Clintons cheek campaigned New Hampshire come third Iowa caucuses The New York Timess Maureen Dowd pilloried Dowd saw window dark part Clintons soul How far political journalism come castigating Ed Muskie crying accusing Clinton calculating tears would help win Shes good politics I take dim view idea journalists successfully anoint political winners The media might bag Barack

emphasis candidates flaws — real perceived — comes cost candidates ability focus message cost negative attention candidates This problem Clinton seems unlikely go away Hillary Clinton comfortable

       " 'Before Its News It fun look polls using data decide candidate win state ultimately candidate win electoral college A lot people organizations reason I don’t I access polls one else sees Were I use polling data directly predict outcomes per state I’d use method like used FiveThirtyEight probably come similar results How boring It would waste time try replicate excellent work done Nate Silver team Back Democratic Primaries I decided I wanted get handle candidate likely win fairly early The polling based estimates inadequate states simply didn’t polling data early process So I invented alternative method made certain estimates voters different ethnic identities would vote That method accurately predicted several primary outcomes outperforming poll based methods used FiveThirtyEight After enough primaries carried I could switch methods slightly Using exact model primed results prior primaries year rather estimates voter behavior I used ethnic distribution data state predict outcome upcoming primary contests Once method accurate performed polling based methods So recently I’ve tried apply similar method estimating electoral outcome year’s presidential race But impossible use exact method entire thing happens one day I can’t use election results handful states estimate likely future outcomes states I recognize polling data limited national level Things happen election season probably change people’s likely voting behavior especially among independents Solid states rarely polled small states swing rarely polled Many polls low quality Right instance fewer half states polls taken fully final POTUS debate b A better rating FiveThirtyEight If I allow use B occasional C ratings recent polls allow polls include periods time prior last POTUS debate states strongly favor one candidate thus likely move anyway I find states sort usable polling data Interestingly states controversial changes happening like Utah Iowa adequately polled In order apply model like one I used Primaries current election I used states somewhat acceptable recent polling data inform model calculate regression coefficients order separately predict likely voting behavior Trump vs Clinton states Before I show map however I need discuss something else About week ago press especially somewhat left leaning press various commenters seeing much reaction series events beginning NYT release Trump’s tax return ending final POTUS debate events sandwiched sexual assault tapes accusations collectively decided huge gap Clinton Trump rapidly opening race would end double digit spread electoral rout big party Soon I pointed may correct That polling data seemed show rather expansion difference two candidates followed reclosing gap Clinton still leading much temporary shift To I added concern If many people assumed race double digit range perhaps could GOTV backlash effect funding effect would shift things within shooting distance Trump I alone thinking I probably right The GOP sunk via pacs million dollars Senate races response Democrats shifting national race Senate followed Democrats shifting back national race certain states presumably recognizing polls artificially spread Indeed criticized arguing mainly incredulity good wishes admonition noted correctly narrowing bunch rightleaning polls come This true ignores bunch leftleaning polls made formation Great Gap GOP Defeat look lot bigger ever really I say part one preparation I’m going tell news want hear Part two logic I’d like bludgeon Consider points True Trump supporters could give rat’s ass sexual assault poor debate performance tax forms Donald Trump correct said weeks ago forgotten could gun someone streets Manhattan would lose support form base These people abandon heard talk sexual assault If anything energized And I’m talking something shy voters We live barely civilized asshole country Please tell exactly Hillary Clinton supporters going vote Clinton Trump along NOW going pick Clinton polled voting day change Clinton supporters Clinton supporters In words somewhat subtle point people hated Trump became True Haters Trump sexual assault thing Almost none They already The third category people undecideds lying undecided cases socalled “reasonable Republicans” could conceivably shift Trump Clinton going divide voting activities Johnson write advised Republican leaders cases simply staying home In words last weeks source emerged hands Secretary Clinton electoral votes probably month ago Trump going least many electoral votes go away Those observations part one logic part two cause utterly unsurprised find analysis electoral map I October th one I today show Clinton pulling farther ahead In fact two analyses Clinton less far ahead Trump ten days ago The difference Ohio shifting Clinton Trump almost certainly going happen North Carolina shifted Clinton Trump analysis seems much less likely happen Arizona shifting Clinton probably wishful thinking Trump The point plain simple An analysis using technique worked well past shows difference moment Maximal Clintonosity today plus minus couple state In words different Maybe little worse Really Here’s current map Obviously I watching data next days I assume spate polls approach November th day Democrats vote Republicans vote th November If convergence method calibration method calculation model consume tail become accurate time But perhaps small number polls recent high quality grow bit I resolve closer states By way “swing states” according model states things close Ohio North Carolina Arizona Georgia

way But one issue — Constitution protects gay citizens — divides defines two like This week’s historic hearing samesex marriage logical extension ultimate showdown decadeslong argument far Kennedy always Here’s fallout ruling could various states Each Kennedy’s bold lyrical rulings behalf gays — “times blind us certain truths later generations see laws thought necessary proper fact serve oppress” wrote Lawrence v Texas — reliably followed meticulous fiery denunciation Scalia “The court taken sides culture war departing role assuring neutral observer democratic rules engagement observed” Scalia answered Lawrence case Kennedy written Supreme Court’s important decisions gay rights protecting civil rights homosexuals Romer v Evans abolishing antigay sodomy laws Lawrence ruling United States v Windsor two years ago federal government must recognize samesex marriages Each steppingstone Supreme Court’s consideration Tuesday whether Constitution forbids states prohibiting gay couples marry If pattern continues court renders landmark ruling favoring gay marriage likely Kennedy whose words memorialize decision Scalia articulate dissent It conflict everyone would predicted two Ronald Reagan’s choices court Scalia ascended bench Kennedy followed months later The two born opposite coasts consistent comrades issues important corporate America dismantling campaign finance laws see restricting political speech After Chief Justice John G Roberts Jr sided liberals declare Affordable Care Act constitutional Scalia Kennedy united Justices Clarence Thomas Samuel A Alito Jr jointly written page dissent mocking majority opinion saying entire act found invalid Kennedy often deciding vote ideologically divided court splits twothirds cases sides conservatives But often arrive conclusion — one obstacle samesex marriage proponents current case Kennedy’s allegiance states’ rights — Kennedy Scalia could different view judge’s role “Their different approach gay rights reflects fundamental disagreement think liberties protected Constitution” said Paul M Smith Washington lawyer winning side Lawrence case Scalia believes freedoms viewed protected Constitution “are protected American law throughout history defined specific level” Smith said Otherwise people decide Kennedy Smith said “believes generation right conceive newer broader forms liberty merit constitutional protection He sees history guide straitjacket” Their battle compelling said Allison Orr Larsen William Mary law professor “brings forefront theoretical question constitutional law How courts respond change interpreting Constitution” Michael Dorf professor Cornell Law School former Kennedy clerk said former boss’s decisions gay rights constructed lead ultimately decision samesex marriage But provided foundation view new constitutional rights “if that’s country moves” Scalia hand champions cause originalism Edward Whelan former Scalia clerk president Ethics Public Policy Center said former boss learned quickly “Kennedy’s judicial approach anything close Scalia’s is” “A basic tenet originalism it’s role judges impose moral philosophies” Whelan said “Scalia understands Constitution leave vast bulk policy issues democratic processes rejects notion it’s role read views Constitution” It’s worth remembering differences among President Reagan’s choices Supreme Court He fulfilled campaign pledge name woman bench Sandra Day O’Connor pragmatic Arizona politician judge quickly became court’s center Scalia’s selection celebrated conservatives eager see new method constitutional interpretation forcefully advocated court Kennedy compromise Reagan’s third choice seat hoped would filled conservative Robert Bork whose nomination defeated Senate “This Bork seat” said Smith “Things could much different” Kennedy’s views Dorf said “moderate California Republican” Although never ruled gay rights lower court judge Kennedy expressed concern policy even upheld military’s right dismiss gay servicemen And Frank J Colucci political science professor Purdue University written book Kennedy’s jurisprudence recalled Kennedy speech criticized Supreme Court’s decision Bowers v Hardwick upheld Georgia statute criminalizing sodomy “He came close lower court judge saying wrongly decided” Colucci said Once court Kennedy able say In first gay rights case Romer Kennedy wrote majority striking Colorado constitutional amendment After cities state began passing laws protecting gays discrimination housing employment areas voters referendum approved amendment precluding government protections Colorado’s amendment Kennedy wrote “classifies homosexuals proper legislative end make unequal everyone else This Colorado cannot A state cannot deem class persons stranger laws” That began something callandresponse issue Kennedy delivering majority’s opinion Scalia replying scalding dissent read bench emphasis “This court business imposing upon Americans resolution favored elite class members institution selected pronouncing ‘animosity’ toward homosexuality evil” Scalia wrote Romer “I vigorously dissent” In Lawrence Kennedy got chance reverse court’s decision sodomy “Bowers correct decided correct today” Private homosexual conduct consenting adults wrote “involves liberty person spatial transcendent dimensions” O’Connor wrote concurring opinion say ruling touch matter whether gays would able marry Scalia wrote homosexuals free promote cause democratic means “many Americans want persons openly engage homosexual conduct partners business scoutmasters children teachers children’s schools boarders home” “They view protecting families lifestyle believe immoral destructive” wrote “The court views ‘discrimination’ ” Two years ago Windsor Kennedy wrote federal government’s refusal offer government benefits available heterosexual couples legally married gay couples tells “all world otherwise valid marriages unworthy” “humiliates” children Again Scalia blasted decision saying majority merely coy saying decision address whether states required give licenses samesex marriage “By formally declaring anyone opposed samesex marriage enemy human decency majority arms well every challenger state law restricting marriage traditional definition” wrote Most federal courts taken Scalia literally “The court agrees Justice Scalia’s interpretation Windsor” wrote US District Judge Robert J Shelby Salt Lake City Shelby’s decision strike marriage ban Utah first ruling following Windsor began path continues Tuesday’s oral arguments

middleclass tax cut The exchange carbon tax involve frank political talk But Plumer also noted Podesta elsewhere makes genuine efforts convince colleagues menace posed climate change need genuinely huge solutions address There examples A debate Cadillac Tax taxes expensive health insurance plans showed twin impulses fighting As Vox written tax widely seen essential way raise revenue Obamacare But it’s also hated unions whose votes endorsements Clinton wanted cultivate primary The emails reveal Clinton’s policy advisers arguing fix strategy political team pushed harder call full repeal They ultimately came fully political side None Clinton’s critics surprised find team debating political ramifications certain policies — it’s certainly widely understood almost politicians make decisions But fair appraisal emails doesnt reduce Team Clinton opportunism Even behind closed doors appear motivated genuine embrace progressive beliefs causes At least much time But always Lets honest Everyone worked big enough office said written something coworker wouldnt say coworker’s face Clintonworld exception But offices don’t deal essentially internal communications dumped unceremoniously web Team Clinton’s internal gossip snipings neatly organized searchable database whole world use These understandably best catnip reporters Like revelations also don’t tend reveal anything genuinely earthshattering But laying bare bitter grievances generally already knew emails fueling added frustration old grudges For instance emails include This kind stuff course least public policy positions campaign But category emails perhaps interesting people work Clinton In terrific article Politico Annie Karni Glenn Thrush detailed psychological impacts it’s Clinton campaign As Karni Thrush note heady time Clintonworld She’s cruising victory polls Donald Trump sunk polls Clinton trounced three consecutive presidential debates In general critics upset Podesta emails ones confirmed Clinton’s

pressure outside groups Her team clear goals they’re also closely attuned polls winning organizations union backers environmentalist groups Black Lives Matter activists whose support think need In private conversations Clinton tells audiences front less want hear But appreciation listeners may reflect political savvy also suggests flexibility may worry left What happens President Clinton gets polling suggesting majority voters support slashing entitlements What country clamors war Iran What win Republican voters tacking center And second anything Podesta emails show Clinton transactional

Warwick Sabin D cheers others protesting states religious freedom law state Capitol Little Rock last month The recent backlash “religious accommodation” laws Indiana Arkansas evidence increasingly bitter confrontation dividing country threatens diminish scope religious liberty America That conclusion number scholars experts urging United States Supreme Court consider confrontation hears oral argument April potential landmark case involving samesex marriage On one side gay couples seeking full benefits equal treatment dignity society long forced secondclass status substantially worse On side religious conservatives say coerced support andor participate activities offend religious beliefs Gay rights activists sensing approaching victory Supreme Court growing aggressive challenging conservatives Many argue accommodation religious beliefs context gay rights would amount “license discriminate” Conservatives counter issue freedom conscience Religious accommodations traditionally provided avoid prospect coercion one’s faith say Indiana Arkansas latest flashpoints could become major turning point For first time US history sizeable social political force seems intent sharply restraining eliminating religious accommodations according scholars study religious freedom Now Supreme Court poised take samesex marriage advocates hoping high court offer muchneeded guidance nation torn conflicting values Some states like Indiana tried address religious accommodation side equation others like Utah taken comprehensive approach – addressing religion accommodations antidiscrimination laws together The stakes involve whether samesex couples able obtain cake photographs flowers wedding Ultimately stake quintessential requirement life America tolerance – side Douglas Laycock leading scholar religious liberty staked middle ground position looming confrontation gay rights religious rights He calls approach “liberty justice all” “Samesex civil marriage great advance human liberty But failure attend religiousliberty implications create whole new set problems liberties religious organizations believers cannot conscientiously recognize facilitate marriages” writes Mr Laycock professor University Virginia School Law friendofthecourt brief He urging high court recognize constitutional right samesex marriage And believes states pass laws barring discrimination based sexual orientation But also favors robust religious freedom restoration laws state level urging justices make clear opinion religious conservatives retain broad freedom live lives accord highest sense morality faith “The gain human liberty greatly undermined samesex couples force religious dissenters violate conscience way dissenters power forced samesex couples hide closet” Laycock said “That happen unless Court clearly directs lower courts protect religious liberty well samesex civil marriage” told justices In speech last fall Sen Orrin Hatch R Utah warned religious liberty attack – losing ground “What broad consensus United States religious freedom deserves special protection recently crumbled” said The senator said gay rights organizations advocacy groups increasingly opposed religious exemptions years ago would passed without dissent “From perspective appears groups believe ‘winning’ argument therefore need religious accommodations” said “Whereas past willing respect religious freedom believe upper hand ready disregard religious liberty altogether” Last June Supreme Court pushed back trend to decision upholding religious accommodation owners Hobby Lobby Within weeks ruling senators voted overturn decision eliminate accommodation The tally four votes short needed advance bill included every Senate Democrat three Republicans The uproar sparked Indiana’s passage Religious Freedom Restoration Act RFRA late March illustrates potential high stakes religious conservatives Indiana lawmakers Republican Gov Mike Pence encountered swift unrelenting backlash wellorganized gay rights campaign supported major business leaders Democratic governors others threatening unleash economic boycott entire state Those threats prompted Republican leaders Indiana Arkansas quickly retreat water religious freedom laws It also directed national spotlight intersection gay rights religious rights It part focusing eighttable pizza shop Walkerton Ind Memories Pizza owner Kevin O’Connor daughter Crystal said would serve gay lesbian customers shop But added would refuse cater samesex wedding ceremony would offend religious beliefs marriage The store closed

local television news reporter Other wellknown cases involve Colorado bakery’s refusal bake wedding cake samesex marriage ceremony New Mexico photographer’s refusal photograph samesex commitment ceremony Washington florist’s decision design floral arrangements samesex wedding In case Christian business owner said refusal based sincerelyheld religious belief sanctity marriage And case courts ruled Christian owners violated laws prohibiting discrimination based sexual orientation “In last year rise push gay rights beyond wanting appreciation respect gay rights Now segment population seeking right trump religious freedom” said Jeffrey Mateer lawyer Liberty Institute Plano Texas “We seeing people faith attacked discriminated losing jobs speaking marriage issue” Mr Mateer said Among cases cited conservatives It isn’t matter filing lawsuits challenging award government benefits certain businesses The broader campaign often portrays religious conservatives bigots The strategy appears aimed discrediting claim American tradition solicitude religious adherents involving sincere matters faith “That’s one way looking it” says Yale Law School Professor William Eskridge “Here’s another way What counts religious reason highly dynamic” In s opponents Civil Rights Act used Bible try justify continued discrimination AfricanAmericans notes Professor Eskridge leading scholar gay rights It didn’t work The tactic swept aside tide public opinion embraced principle equality AfricanAmericans Eskridge suggests matter time gay rights become normalized across country religious moral arguments swept aside discarded “One lessons history unfortunately often line bigotry religious doctrine religious faith clearcut line particularly public opinion swiftly changing” Eskridge said The professor predicted nation’s rapid embrace gay rights continues public norms law also change So religious practice belief said “We’ve already seen And going continue see it” said “Some religions literally changing doctrine” So leave state interplay gay rights activists religious conservatives The legal landscape patchwork Even US Supreme Court rules late June states must issue marriage licenses samesex couples states currently laws prohibiting discrimination based sexual orientation That means gay men lesbians vulnerable discrimination states Among states Indiana Arkansas Some observers view recent ugly flareup culture war states missed opportunity Had officials Indiana Arkansas sought pass new religious freedom restoration laws concert new legal protections lesbian gay bisexual transgender LGBT community energy invested threatened boycotts waging heated protests would expended instead celebrations leadership progress analysts say Robin Fretwell Wilson knows get done She adviser effort one conservative states America “At time great change people know rules are” says Ms Fretwell professor University Illinois College Law The idea get relevant parties around table negotiate set rules acceptable It employs common sense approach If sensitive concerns we’ll sensitive The result Utah Compromise It passed Republicancontrolled state legislature signed law last month blessing Church Jesus Christ Latterday Saints When takes effect May mark first time state history gay men lesbians bisexuals transgender people specific legal protections prohibiting discrimination housing employment sexual orientation gender identity “Utah gets right every single score” Wilson says “They something good decent LGBT community make come expense religious believers I think that’s huge” The workplace protections apply businesses workers including state agencies local governments school districts It apply religious organizations religious schools whollyowned subsidiaries religious organizations It also exempts Boy Scouts The compromise critics Some say go far enough For example Utah Compromise address thorny issue public accommodations – whether small business bakery wedding planner florist must participate samesex wedding ceremonies religious objections But within compromise seeds solution problem well Wilson says The agreement establishes right qualified person Utah get married county clerk’s office But agreement official clerk’s office fired otherwise forced officiate samesex wedding religious objection Instead every clerk’s office Utah – including rural counties – must process provides willing celebrant samesex couple seeking marry clerk’s office There term kind approach It called religious accommodation Wilson says developing similar model may offer compromise religious business owners worried getting sued religious objections participating samesex wedding In medical field recognized abortion conscience clauses exempt certain medical professionals involvement procedure religious beliefs In effect someone else takes place prearranged process “When happens one says mean lady wants abortion” Wilson said “We don’t even think way” The prearranged process could set Christianowned bakery flower shop In essence parts business serving samesex marriages would handled workers inhouse contract religious objection ceremonies “The idea show moment get refused religious person really really hard choke I don’t think gay rights people going able bargain that” Wilson says “And idea suddenly let gay rights run roughshod every religious person community also hard choke down” She adds “So find model everybody gets served religious people don’t leave jobs I think we’d really good thing” Wilson’s approach holds great promise particularly conservative red states looking solutions avoid economic boycotts But everyone ready willing negotiate ceasefire culture war That’s concept RFRA may become essential increasing number cases move courts Much controversy last month Indiana Arkansas premised misinformation misconceptions sides debate according legal experts Some conservatives false impression RFRA would offer guaranteed protection lawsuits samesex couples And gay rights activists argued incorrectly Indiana RFRA would “license discriminate” Uncritical press reports parroted line The debate kicked gobs dust fury shed almost light real purpose passing state RFRA analysts say “I don’t think right view RFRAs light gay rights specifically RFRA always protected religious minority groups” says Eric Rassbach lawyer Becket Fund Religious Liberty Washington He says RFRAs helped protect Santeria priest seeking exemption local ordinance outlawing goat sacrifices invoked help native Americans need exemption federal law possess eagle feathers The law used uphold right Sikh accountant pass security federal building possession religious “kirpan” small dull dagger symbolic Sikhs cross Christians In January US Supreme Court applied RFRAlike statute ruled Arkansas prison system must allow Muslim inmate grow short beard compliance religious faith That ruling “If people want go around stopping RFRAs neutering RFRAs people going hurt religious minorities – Sikhs native Americans Muslims Orthodox Jews” Mr Rassbach said “I think real problem society getting less religiously diverse becoming heterogeneous” said The purpose passing religious freedom restoration law grant right engage antigay discrimination Rassbach analysts say The law isn’t designed work way hasn’t worked way practice No religious exemption sought RFRA ever granted case involving alleged sexual orientation discrimination That doesn’t mean won’t accommodation granted future But results suggest RFRA “license discriminate” The real license discriminate Indiana state’s lack statute prohibiting discrimination sexual orientation That license discriminate legal experts say In contrast purpose RFRA different The law designed allow neutral judge weigh competing interests law applied broadly imposes significant burden sincerelyheld religious beliefs When happens must proof provision advances compelling government interest tailored way least restrictive religious faith This approach dreamed backroom legislative chamber Indiana It legal standard recognized constitutional guarantee entire country enforced US Supreme Court Despite broad constitutional protection religious conscience religious adherents didn’t always prevail In Bob Jones University argued religious exemption federal regulation prohibiting taxexempt organizations discriminating basis race The university rule barring interracial dating The high court held government fundamental – overriding – interest ending vestige racial discrimination education Though decision diminish importance religious accommodations general put religious adherents notice fighting discrimination compelling government interest outweigh claim religious accommodation Then high court abruptly changed course The justices presented case involving two drug counselors fired sacramental use peyote members Native American Church They also denied unemployment benefits The two sued state Oregon seeking religious accommodation would allow collect benefits A divided Supreme Court ruled free exercise clause Constitution authorize religious exemption laws general applicability This major constitutional shift made difficult religious adherents – particularly minority religions – seek accommodations general laws imposed significant burdens faith Congress responded passing Religious Freedom Restoration Act It passed House voice vote Senate The statute reestablished national legal standard religious accommodation enforced high court Then Supreme Court ruled federal RFRA applied federal law state local level In response decision states began enacting religious freedom restoration acts Currently states – including Indiana Arkansas – enacted RFRAs In addition states interpreted state constitutions providing guarantees religious liberty consistent standard enforced US Supreme Court Thus states fashion embraced broad concept offering religious accommodations How approaching legal battles play uncertain Some cases preempted automatic exemptions discrimination laws long granted religious organizations affiliated groups But stage set litigation public accommodations related samesex marriages Ironically cases litigated conservative “red” states liberal “blue” states already accepted gay marriage That’s antidiscrimination statutes red states would allow samesex couple file lawsuit “It middle area small business individual proprietorship mom pop enterprise that’s area going bite” Eskridge says “That play highly dynamic” The professor sees legal landscape shifting accommodation claims “Accommodations would given courts years ago going given courts years even today cases” In courts across country critical question going whether possible strike balance discrimination religious accommodation What stake fundamental cakes photographs flowers It whether point politicians judges begin look ways defuse disputes sides start moving forward together toward tolerance acceptance The alternative Indianastyle protests boycotts “What devastating religious community seen saying religious freedom knock gay rights When say stuff like – ugly – lose”

help – scores protesters gathered outside seat British prime minister Saturday holding signs calling government “Save Aleppo” impose “NoBomb Zone Now” While anger understandable way channeled reflects circumscribed policy debate – options NoFly Zone avoided would harm rather help efforts alleviate suffering Syrian civilians In area policy mainstream debate revolves around policy alternatives reflect establishment divisions For example economics ‘there alternative’ neoliberalism least wasn’t Keynesianism rediscovered elites crisis The debate done Syria revolves around two policy alternatives hawks including likely next US president Hillary Clinton advocate NFZ doves including current US administration maintain sanctions regime increased This effectively reflects division within establishment proceed Serious policy alternatives discussed In particular discussion increasing aid support refugees surely obvious way directly helping civilians Syria UN called industrialized countries curious absence This circumscribed debate logically follow supposed pretext – stopping civilian loss life In fact NFZ policy would unavoidably lead civilians dying Enforcing NFZ means destroying air defenses located defend cities – ie located areas many civilians Even flagbearer hawks Hillary Clinton admitted privately NoFly Zone “you’re going kill lot Syrians” intervention “take lot civilians” This realization would seem inconsistent oftenused humanitarian pretext makes sense given Hillary Clinton’s recent admission top priority Syria removing Syrian President Assad There clear parallel imposition NFZ Libya prolonged conflict worsened situation civilians NATO bombing directly led scores civilian deaths facilitated overthrow regime rebel militias killed continuing kill thousands Particularly repugnant ethnic cleansing black people including public lynching In paper Alan Kuperman Harvard academic argued NATO intervention extended war factor increased death toll times given Libya failed state torn apart warlords safely say estimates conservative President Obama privately calls situation Libya “ shit show ” Only last month report Foreign Affairs Committee British Parliament found humanitarian justification insufficient pretext based falsehoods supposedly limited intervention led “ineluctably” regime change British government implication participating Western powers seriously consider diplomatic alternatives military action Regardless mantra Western foreign policy “it different time” – unlike recent Western military interventions one limited successful won’t leave worse humanitarian situation wake Although dire humanitarian situation Aleppo necessitates immediate action equally loud calls action civilians facing similar situations US bombing Manbij Kobane Syria Ramadi Fallujah Iraq resulted thousands civilian deaths flattened entire neighbourhoods third US UK backed Saudi airstrikes Yemen hit civilian sites including schools hospitals weddings funerals Talking meant distraction relativization fact US Saudi Arabia engaged similar activities make bombing Aleppo less objectionable However raise questions motives pushing hard nofly zone If western foreign policy actors allies press motivated humanitarian concerns surely stopping atrocities appear policy agenda – especially given action required easier risk war Russia If humanitarian considerations really important factors foreign policy debate would discussion legitimacy aerial bombardment cities towns given invariably leads civilian deaths International agreements successful making chemical biological weapons illegal prohibition generally followed though always The first wellpublicized use aerial bombardment Nazi bombing Guernica caused righteous popular outrage Tragically however use became normalized Second World War ban aerial bombing cities included postwar international settlement The fact seems hopelessly idealistic reflects fact geopolitics humanitarian considerations govern international relations foreign policy discussion human suffering nothing useful pretext whatever actions want take order secure geopolitical advantage The US allies want remove Syria Russia’s orbit therefore dictator must go airstrikes support dictator Yemen fine dictator friend close US ally Saudi Arabia There added complication NFZ Syria marks return ColdWar era brinkmanship possible armed confrontation Russia The logic brinkmanship runs make geopolitical gains one must escalate level make side back partly convincing enemy ready commit irrational acts There inherent danger game states nuclear armed consequences spiral escalation could devastating Syria hawks close Obama aide Ben Rhodes called “ prostupid shit ” caucus argue NFZ lead Russia effectively back example Clinton argued “give us leverage conversations Russia” Interestingly exchange quote Clinton indicated war goal NFZ make Russia “put Assad future political diplomatic track” – ie Russia forced accept regime change After despite panic press Russia actually feeble successor state superpower would come worse direct conflict preeminent might North America logic runs However ‘dovish’ Western foreign policy actors point danger advanced Russian materiel support Syria poses enforcement NFZ Unlike recent US military adventures enforcing NFZ Syria could lead significant politically unpalatable American casualties – pilots shot This realization means saner establishment figures opposed NFZ For example US Army General Carter Ham oversaw NFZ Libya said NFZ “violent combat action results lots casualties increased risk personnel” Instead relative doves like current Secretary State John Kerry advocate intensifying sanctions regime Syria Russia Again seem seriously helping civilians A leaked UN report revealed existing Western sanctions regime preventing humanitarian aid creating humanitarian disaster threatens rival caused OilforFood program Iraq s The history

MSM blatantly supports terrorists The nexus politicians terrorism media well known intelligence community However links cozy connections usually written mere coincidence We told arms funding illegally receive accidental byproduct supporting “freedom fighters” one planned groups transformed terrorist organisations This tip iceberg nowadays Radical Islamists considered rebels main stream media described “spoilers” US State Department whose main spokesman John Kirby recently referred AlNusra East Aleppo spoiler ceasefire Syria The way US government MSM support terrorists nothing come surprise And accidental specific spokesperson appointed run media spin operation Meet John Kirby – man call terrorism anything Retired Rear Admiral Kirby official US State Department Spokesperson He graduate Naval War College Newport Rhode Island rather US Naval Academy Annapolis holds degrees history international relations national security strategic studies He worked informationbased roles throughout armed forces career though usually speaking goverment rather public steady yearonyear increases US military spending show effective role Kirby Pentagon spokesman He used Pentagon spokesman well positioned present sensitive information noncontroversial packages mass public consumption The Pentagon hardly likely tell us truth things public interested rows generals unauthorised illegal actions generals really think politicians serve But press service regardless turn something benign equally interesting far security clearance allow This Kirby’s direction radical Islamist groups commit acts meet definition terrorism even agree cause referred simply “rebels” mainstream media “spoilers” State Department Listen example Kirby referring AlNusra “spoiler” ceasefire East Aleppo He also neat trick minimising terrorism refers Daesh silly name Dash word Americans familiar athletics conjures images educated young people running gear rather hooded terrorists murdering beheading marauding His statements Dash really questionable People probably think funny families beheaded people killed ISIS would find funny It sick Readers disgusted Kirby Perhaps guys think terrorists controlled managed However tell public war radical Islamists Al Nusra others terrorist watch list “national security experts” allowed give pass allies The key allies radical Islamists attacked us lots others Those allies supporting conflict Syria Western governments always telling public war radical Islamists Al Nusra groups designated terrorists eliminated kill list All kinds actions taken name fighting terrorism Western soldiers sent die faraway places So Kirby presented “national security expert” allowed talk cuddly allies insignificant hardly worth billions spent fighting Terratwitter army Wars definition controversial always attract comment Everyone opinion given conflict important point see make So always endless stream people could called upon comment media The way give credibility contributor chosen present particular qualification Kirby’s title unquestionably gives one There also close action disagree anything Kirby says including many troops State Department sent fight conflicts However one way skin cat If Homeland Security wants track actual terrorists look source Twitter feeds find shapes forms many members Islamist Front It clear even prominent main stream journalists actually supporting “rebels” engaging learned exchanges Have ever noticed certain articles statements attract large number comments saying thing These allegedly members public therefore inference “neutral” response man woman street rather interested party However “vox pop” system easy manipulate plenty evidence actually happening Many Twitter feeds comments conflicts involving terrorists allegedly “the general public” actually members Islamic Front traced back One example Twitter account Montheramirramzi Yet mainstream journalists call individuals They engage impartial observers whose observations prove points made articles commenters happen read amongst dozens available given time plenty things lives A State Department Spokesman long reach You lot weapons place take Pentagon even verbal battle Are believe journalists working Islamic Front independently without help Too good good No one wants live repressive regime Consequently easy convey notion “rebel” simply decent person fighting injustice every individual likes think People tend make connection without looking deeper takes lot effort casual observers willing make go details conflict build counternarrative one presented mainstream media The term “rebel” used cover kinds combatants Syria It includes “moderate opposition” selfavowed terrorists In order make fiction stand lot claims need made lot things reported would counter picture homogenous group decent people taking stand obvious need explained It rarely reported moderate opposition persuaded reject UN plan kick Al Nusra much threat ambitions moderate opposition Syrian government The opposition Assad forcibly led terrorists West claims fighting moderate forces subjected West This Kirby refers Daesh Dash – implying moderate forces fully agreement somehow makes something terrorist group way Al Qaeda partially rehabilitated saying name becomes familiar breakfast reading public Similarly word “Christian” bandied American audience increasingly influenced religious right mushroomed backlash failed liberalism Kirby assistants claim Christians persecuted Assad Muslim without going exactly meant “Christians” ramifications holding faith Most Syrian Christians describe Orthodox split two different groups One Patriarchate Antioch based Damascus either Jacobite Syrian church Nestorian Assyrian church outside mainstream Orthodox communion since th century Politically different animals – Church Antioch uses Arabic services part deal state protection whereas Syrians generally use Syriac Nestorians Aramaic Nor receive protection treated suspicious minorities Syrian state It lies behind kidnapping ongoing detention two bishops Syrian Church’s Archbishop John Ibrahim Church Antioch’s Metropolitan Paul Yazigi held ISIS since This intended convey idea Christians must therefore hate Assad We told whereabouts two bishops unknown told Terry Waite Church England peace envoy held captive Beirut five years Islamic Jihad Organisation On occasion sophisticated weapons targeting systems intelligence disposal West couldn’t find one captive city raids demonstrated knew backwards Bishop Paul Metropolitan Aleppo strangely enough Too many friends true The radical Islamists presented cuddly flies ointment Kirby sponsored external governments We often told include Saudi Arabia Turkey Qatar Many questions raised Western countries state sponsors terrorism allies states’ real attitude terrorism therefore Minimising actions groups therefore domestic political imperative merely foreign relations security one Western governments This Channel News published report “Aleppo – Up Close With The Rebels” October th It attempt promote known war criminals child murderers thus cleanse actions governments support supply means committing When people started recognising certain faces video connecting actions caused journalists question US government’s support particular rebel group Channel removed report unusually It however changed editorial policy presents groups similar records way spite There also connection John Kerry’s recent discussions Saudi foreign minister Adel alJubeir It known classified

JASTA restrict sovereign immunity make easier individuals prosecute Saudi state basis official report It also make easier countries pass parallel legislation result US prosecuted actions This may explain Obama vetoed bill passed veto Now Kerry trying fix bill never comes effect If enacted could significant effect future conflicts enabling believe actions sovereign nation Syria criminal pursue legal rather military avenues This option “moderate” groups would doubtless prefer This gives US militaryindustrial complex people profit war every motive presenting radical terrorists reasonable sensible people sensible thing Everyone wins except future Most terrorist groups would equally radical behaviour able achieve much let devices would neither weaponry intelligence support The reason terrorists happy martyred Western infidels accept support somehow legitimises hope future favours Menachem Begin former Israeli PM Nobel Prize Winner Peace still wanted UK Zionist bombing attended Leeds Castle Middle East peace negotiations enjoyed dignity Prime Minister rather terrorist West said John Kirby still serving purposes Pentagon presenting terrorists reasonable insignificant forces Not continuing US sponsorship terrorism justifying billions spent fighting apparently insignificant threat Now Pentagon unlimited funds spend anything sell public Isn’t wonderful picture connect dots

Valdai Club actively take part work Your expertise enables understand angles processes underway Russia world forecast evaluate longterm trends put forward new initiatives recommendations help us find way prosperous sustainable future badly need Thank much attention … comments end Vladimir Putin I would like make quick response Mr Fischer said He mentioned discussions EU trade agreement Canada This internal EU matter permit I would like make one small remark I know Europe find Wallonia’s position irritating region home million people million people blocking decision issue global importance namely trade agreement Canada But Belgium took part EU’s creation basis particular principles including Belgium overall Wallonia would certain rights The EU grown greatly since much different membership rules changed Perhaps rules need changed case would first give people created organisation chance change democratic process obtain approval As dispute I familiar details Europeans course whatever prerogatives EU supranational bodies note I already spoken publicly point European Parliament adopts far greater number binding decisions regard member states USSR Supreme Soviet regard Soviet Union’s constituent republics Soviet period It us say whether good bad We want see strong centralised Europe This position But Europe many different views I hope whole issue resolved positive fashion On matter UN I said say must return written UN Charter universal organisation world If renounce UN sure road chaos There universal alternative world Yes world changed yes UN Security Council need reform reconstruction But say Foreign Ministry way preserve organisation’s effectiveness We basis broad consensus We need ensure vast majority international actors give support reforms Today must return common understanding principles international law enshrined UN Charter This UN established World War II particular balance power world Later collapse Soviet Union United States decided one coordinate things really need get anyone’s approval fundamental matters This start everything First s airstrikes Belgrade I go humanitarian aspect preceded decisions seeing airstrikes carried heart Europe end twentieth century seemed simply barbaric This done violation UN Charter without approval When happened people immediately started saying old rules outdated something change Things got worse events Iraq Did UN sanction operations Iraq No Before operations Afghanistan Yes know tragedy September even existing international law relevant UN Security Council resolution sought first done Then came Iraq came resolution Libya You experts read resolution Libya know establishing nofly zone But kind nofly zone speak airstrikes began Libyan territory This flagrant violation UN Charter And came Syria It either Tarja Heinz said operations Aleppo increasing number terrorists But terrorist ranks start swelling Aleppo Were terrorists Iraq There terrorists country’s state structures destroyed The true Libya terrorists But soon country’s statehood destroyed came along fill vacuum Terrorists The happening Syria I understand insinuations made action Aleppo elsewhere But let’s remember soon conflict began Syria began long became involved terrorists appeared began receiving arms supplies I mentioned opening remarks Attempts made train terrorists set alAssad options groups effective This continues today effective fighting units think possible make use sort later But illusion It won’t work problem I would also like respond absolutely proper developments Finland instance Bells tolling killed Aleppo Bells also tolling losing lives Mosul vicinity The operation Mosul getting underway As far I know terrorists already shot people hope stopping offensive town Let’s forget And Afghanistan Whole wedding parties people wiped single airstrike A single strike Have forgotten And what’s happening Yemen Let bells toll innocent victims I agree We keep hearing Aleppo Aleppo Aleppo But issue Do leave nest terrorists place squeeze best minimise avoid civilian casualties If better go offensive Mosul shouldn’t go ahead either Let’s leave everything Let’s leave Raqqa alone Our partners keep saying “We need take back Raqqa eliminate nest terrorists there” But civilians Raqqa So fight terrorists And take hostages towns leave Look Israel’s example Israel never steps back always fights end survives There alternative We need fight If keep retreating always lose Regarding Tarja said subject security Baltic Sea area I remind matter came initiative visit Naantali Finland initiative Mr Niinisto president Finland Quite blue requested Russian aircraft fly transponders For familiar military matters I note transponders instruments signal aircraft’s location air Of course aircraft fly transponders increases security Baltic Sea region This truth matter I responded immediately noting firstly far flights NATO aircraft region aircraft Secondly I promised Finnish President would definitely raise issue partners next RussiaNATO Council meeting I tell The result NATO partners rejected Putin’s proposal said But nothing Putin They rejected proposal made Mr Niinisto president Finland This straightforward matter us either I would say technical dimension involved purely military dimension But I give Defence Ministry instructions find way without detriment security The Defence Ministry found solution NATO colleagues rejected So please direct questions NATO headquarters Brussels Vladimir Putin I think intervention country another country’s internal political process unacceptable matter attempts made help cyberattacks instruments organisations controlled outside within country You know happened Turkey example position taken President Turkey Recep Erdogan He believes coup attempt Turkey undertaken groups inspired direct help organisation run certain Gulen lived United States last years This unacceptable cyberattacks unacceptable But probably cannot avoid impact including cyberspace Your question specific matter electoral system though I think absolutely unacceptable How avoid sort thing happen I think way reach agreement come rules common understanding recognised government state level verified Of course issue internet freedom everything related arises know many countries including support internet freedom take practical steps restrict access concern people’s interests This concerns cybercrime example attacks banking systems illegal money transfers It concerns suicides crimes children forth These measures taken national level We take appropriate measures national level intergovernmental level Vladimir Putin On question favourites US presidential campaign said media created view Yes case chance In observation rare occasion mass media forms view purely chance I think idea inserted public consciousness middle US presidential campaign pursues sole aim supporting defending interests Ms Clinton Democratic Party candidate fight Republican Party candidate case Donald Trump How done First create enemy form Russia say Trump preferred candidate This complete nonsense totally absurd It’s tactic domestic political struggle way manipulating public opinion elections take place As I said many times know exactly expect either candidates win We know Mr Trump would wins know Ms Clinton would would go ahead go ahead Overall really matter us wins Of course welcome public words willingness normalize relations two countries In sense yes welcome statements matter makes That I say really As Mr Trump chosen method reaching voters’ hearts Yes behaves extravagantly course see But I think sense actions I say view represents interests sizeable part American society tired elites power decades He simply representing ordinary people’s interests He portrays ordinary guy criticizes power decades like see power handed inheritance example We read analysis including American analysis Some experts written openly He operates niche The elections soon show whether effective strategy As I cannot repeat I said already work whichever president American people choose wants work us Question Mr President question follows subject security addressed Obviously cooperation essential part realise cooperation always easy We saw example case transponders The planes still fly least But areas vital importance areas innocent people’s lives stake You mentioned recently case Tsarnayev brothers As far I know Russia passed information action taken Does mean practical cooperation security critical situation Vladimir Putin I spoke matter meeting French journalists I recall correctly Yes passed information Tsarnayev brothers American partners We wrote received response After wrote second time got reply US citizens none business would take care everything I told director FSB archive file The response received still archives Sadly months later Boston marathon terrorist attack took place people killed It great shame tragedy took place If contacts trust us partners better could avoided The Americans came immediately following attack gave information possession But late People already lost lives This partly answers last question We know say want work us really say quite rightly essential us especially fight terrorism In sense welcome declare intentions As I also said past Americans provided us real help preparations Olympic Games Sochi example grateful Our cooperation efficient site level intelligence service heads There good examples cooperation Overall quite good situation area European partners We open professional contacts French intelligence services example exchange information In general situation bad could lot better Sabine Fischer There discussion sending policing mission Donbass also emphasis roadmap saw Russia example media political debate I think really case diverging interpretations results Vladimir Putin This secret I tell I might leave something put anyone difficult position interfere process As know Minsk agreements I think experts read say black white “Thirty days signing Minsk agreements Ukraine’s Rada must adopt resolution outlining geographical boundaries areas law special status unrecognised republics would become effective immediately” Because thing needed work description geographical boundaries That established law parliamentary resolution resolution finally adopted even past deadline So one would think law take effect immediately It passed I would like remind Parliament Ukraine The lawmakers voted coordinated unrecognised republics important sense view makes viable legislation key element political settlement But passing resolution Ukraine Parliament adopted amendment paragraph Article said law would take effect municipal elections areas That postponed law’s enforcement I repeat opinion law absolutely key political resolution crisis southeastern Ukraine Moreover done without even consulting anyone least unrecognised republics We discussed actively year ago Paris I insisted done done immediately part Minsk Agreements view key component But Ukrainian president said possible everything ended dead end In situation everything could ended year ago Paris Mr Steinmeier German Foreign Minister suddenly proposed compromise He suggested agree law come force day local elections regions temporarily come force permanently OSCE Office Democratic Institutions Human Rights recognises elections taken place accordance OSCE rules This set Minsk Agreements order get us deadlock I expressed agreement said would settle matter Donetsk Lugansk But Berlin Ukrainian president suddenly also attempted change proposal already result compromise He went even essentially renouncing law’s implementation whatever case We thus found back crisis Paris year But I want note Federal Chancellor’s role She found arguments persuade everyone present could keep agreement reached said possible change we’d already agreed year later would never reach agreement But agreed bundle nuances details would implemented together concept spoke still worked That really But principle lot accomplished terms ensuring security We reached agreement nearly every point We made little progress humanitarian matters These regions remain tightly blockaded difficult situation But socalled civilised world prefers notice I want get debate matter As far Normandy format goes whether useful simply alternative Yes discussions proceed difficulty effective I agree option want make progress continue working format As question getting actors involved position opposed idea others taking part including American partners But reached agreement participants process work parallel American colleagues My aide Ms Nuland regular meetings discuss issues look compromise This done secret though course All participants Normandy format meetings informed take account American partners’ position course Angela Stent This question President Putin I’m Angela Stent I’m professor Georgetown University Washington Mr President Russia recently withdrew agreement United States dispose weaponsgrade plutonium time Russian Government said would consider rejoining agreement three conditions met firstly NATO troops withdraw level Europe secondly Magnitsky Act repealed thirdly sanctions imposed Russia beginning Ukraine crisis lifted Russia paid compensation So question new President January I’m optimistic Are understand United States three conditions would form basis initial negotiating position Russian part American president reestablishes highlevel relations Kremlin Thank Vladimir Putin One tell straight away academic diplomat If ask diplomats tell concept ‘starting position’ As decision Plutonium Management Disposition Agreement withdraw The United States withdrew missile defence treaty withdraw plutonium agreement suspended Why What agreement’s provisions Under terms countries build facilities disposing surplus weaponsgrade plutonium accumulated Russia USA Not USA meet obligations agreement said would financial difficulties As Russia financial difficulties built facility disposing plutonium using industrial methods Without prior coordination us United States made unilateral announcement would dilute weaponsgrade plutonium would store beds forth This means retain experts call return potential words plutonium could returned reenriched moment But eliminating plutonium using industrial methods We built facility spent money Are wealthier United States There many issues become difficult discuss current administration practically obligations met agreements respected including Syria Perhaps able come back We ready case talk new president look solutions even difficult issues Question Mr President question Russian policy towards Asia The emphasis today Russian foreign policy construction multipolar world But also give thought importance multipolar Asia Both speech today general construction Russian foreign policy points I think growing deepening contradictions US West one hand Eurasian situation But it’s also fact internal contradictions within Eurasia The rise new powers creating lot fears breakdown old order parts releasing primordial forces These internal Eurasia But danger Russia emphasis multipolar world underestimating dangers unipolar Asia need great powers work together construct genuinely democratic multipolar Asia Vladimir Putin We actively developing relations Asian countries tension relations Europe United States simply life dictates choice Why I say life dictates expand contacts The Asian countries’ development influence growing continue what’s growing fast With sizeable part territory Asia Russia would foolish make use geographical advantages develop ties neighbours China neighbour I mentioned opening remarks We longstanding good relations India would mistake make use develop solid longterm relations India today We many common interests We naturally complement politics economy As question multipolar unipolar Asia see Asia unipolar evident Life diverse complex general full contradictions It important resolve contradictions civilised fashion I think Asian countries’ leaders today sufficient common sense work way ready work way I visited India recently Defence Minister returned India We cooperation defence ministries also industry defence sector well civilian sector many common interests India China Vietnam countries region These ties extensive promising Thomas Gomart In September Valdai Club described relations Ukraine Russia following sentence “Two countries one people” Today would describe relations two countries Thank much Vladimir Putin I go blame I always considered still today Russians Ukrainians really one people There people hold radical nationalist views Russia Ukraine But overall majority one people people share common history culture ethnically close First divided set blame We must find way situation I sure common sense prevail find solution Question Mr President putting question I would like pass young students’ words Two years ago came Shanghai important business students missed chance meet university ask question asked tell would happy see time regardless whether retired My question follows We discussed philosophical matter international relations today Humanity already gone different types international systems In view extent future systems resemble past ones What positive components emphasise particular Should seek universality diversity far principles go What kind combination components would prefer see And I specific question We actively discussing relations Russia West China Vladimir Putin Heinz said philosophical question could spend long time discussing Will tomorrow’s world resemble past No course How possible Does today’s China resemble China ss They two completely different countries Soviet Union gone today Mr Mbeki spoke Africa I share arguments But Africa cannot kind peripheral place If anyone thinks way deeply mistaken If follow kind thinking expect serious trials ahead We already hear talk refugees Syria I saw today news latest incident Mediterranean Italian coastguard rescued refugees Africa What Syria got Africa’s future world’s future serious issues The goes relations Asia also many conflicts potential conflict situations I want repeat I said The question whether wisdom courage find acceptable solutions various problems complicated conflicts I certainly hope case world really become multipolar views actors international community taken account No matter whether country big small universally accepted common rules guarantee sovereignty peoples’ interests As relations partners Europe United States America general Asian countries multivector policy This virtue geographical location Our policy regard partners built basis equality mutual respect Alexei Mukhin Alexei Mukhin Centre Political Technology Mr President Ukraine constantly trying prohibit things Russian We get impression everything Russian squeezed Ukrainian life In respect I philosophical question Petro Poroshenko said plans sell Russian business interests Does business actually exist What view Vladimir Putin We seek respect ownership rights Mr Kudrin staunch advocate property rights seeing one pillars economic policy I fully agree We always entirely successful area still improvements make much legislative work always keep working direction The concerns foreign investors including Ukraine Mr Poroshenko one investors sense owner sizeable business Lipetsk Region Roshen factory Actually two businesses The second engaged selling products far I know There problems concerning nonreturn VAT courts imposed restrictions factories operating paying wages earning profits restrictions using profits including transferring abroad I recall figures get detail I know business turning profit working success Pyotr Dutkevich Pyotr Dutkevich Canada Mr President I already put question yesterday Deputy Foreign Minister I realise mistake person question really addressed My question follows We heard reports I know accurate discussed ceasefire Syria meeting Mr Obama September I know accurate information seems day ceasefire proposed You expressed doubts said would possible separate radicals moderates short time task would likely prove impossible You given answer failed task would free hand Can recall conversation It important history taking place Syria Vladimir Putin Yes I need recall I never forgot It important conversation There indeed talk lines Russian Syrian aircraft would cease airstrikes terrorist targets Aleppo healthy opposition forces could separated forces Jabhat alNusra terrorist organisation recognised United Nations included list international terrorist organisations In respect I note secret American partners promised First recognised need second recognised part Aleppo occupied terrorist organisations – ISIS Jabhat alNusra We see news reports see banners ISIS Jabhat alNusra parts city They recognised needs done assured us would After agreed would decide right battlefield moderates would touch terrorists American partners would target terrorists They made repeated promises These promises made level defence ministers foreign ministers intelligence services unfortunately fell time keep promises The question raised meeting China Yes American partner President Obama indeed propose separating different forces But insisted must first declare Dday cease hostilities stop airstrikes within days would take responsibility separating moderates Jabhat alNusra I go detail I think I right make details public After talks like always things say confidence But fact remains Instead separating Jabhat alNusra terrorists healthy opposition American partners broke ceasefire I originally insisted first separate terrorists moderates would end airstrikes end I decided agree American proposal talks They persistent I decided accept compromise said would go proposal declare ceasefire first stop airstrikes giving seven days asked The ceasefire declared September I think th American aircraft carried strike Syrian troops followed ISIS offensive We told strike mistake ISIS offensive coincidence Perhaps ceasefire broken blame As US President promised didn’t promise ask I imagine speak European partners goes Europe I think done openly honestly simply attempt use influence position Syria By way realise Russian Syrian aircraft carrying operations around Aleppo days We gave days already soon days But effort separate terrorists moderates You realise meet obligations never succeed fight terrorism I realise easy task looking make accusations try keep promises In case end accused every possible sin This simply indecent We showing restraint respond partners insolence limit everything might reply point Vladimir Putin I turn Tarja Heinz know well OSCE works But I give opinion President Poroshenko advanced initiative socalled policing mission duration possible future elections Donbass Donetsk Lugansk I one supported It another matter I describe policing mission parties process objected They objected want help Mr Poroshenko OSCE never done anything like It experience people practice implementing policing missions At point parties process supported idea Mr Poroshenko advanced I However describe initiative “a policing mission” opportunity responsible elections security campaign carry weapons Those objected initiative pointed could provoke others use weapons armed people They believe power OSCE observers weapons fact represent respectable international organisation use weapons armed absolutely unacceptable seen least acceptable behaviour This power guns On hand Mr Poroshenko believes would help cause I agree However I one The situation strange issue I agree Mr Poroshenko I spoken nothing new Ultimately parties agreed done careful consideration including OSCE I think never happened OSCE history If I wrong Tarja correct What think Tarja TColton Representative Beijing please Question Thank Just former President Austria Mr Fischer said relationship EU Russia expected years ago It’s unfortunate it’s hard optimistic So I want ask Mr President point view And expectations assumptions years ago wrong something go wrong along way And philosophical point view think lesson learned next years Vladimir Putin What done correctly Expectations high Soviet Union switched policy openness since ideological differences considered main cause division Soviet Union Russia Western world disappeared Frankly Soviet Union Gorbachev Russia believed new life would begin us One experts rightly said things found run even deeper ideological differences namely national geopolitical interests Could done things differently Yes indeed During previous meeting room I said German politician Mr Rau wellknown figure Social Democratic Party Germany longer us used engage lively discussions Soviet leaders Back said conversations record cannot get around publishing need new international security system built Europe In addition NATO said imperative create another entity would include Soviet Union former Warsaw Pact countries participation United States order balance system He went say fail ultimately entire system created Cold War would work Soviet Union He said bothers would unbalance entire system international relations security Europe would jeopardised big way What old gentleman warned us time The people worked transforming world want change anything believed already riding high others political act absolutely correct ideas wise experienced German politician However I hope global alignment forces world changes political diplomatic regulatory support changes follow The world balanced multipolar place Heinz Fischer I also add years ago early ’s And early ’s European Union members Sweden Finland Austria joined ’ ’ It sort honeymoon time Russia Europe particular Russia Germany Russia important European countries It time economic crisis growth rates bigger It even time introduction Euro Euro important Euro also accompanied problems look Greece Italy etc So factors also taken consideration Thank Tarja Halonen I also add years ago Russia different European Union different Russia joined Council Europe quite long process I also involved So I think one lesson could perhaps learn also EU side Council Europe side good time make enlargement But perhaps fair invest enlargement process enlargement also afterwards perhaps process could easier today But know sometimes things hurried quite enough time But cannot take back past try build Gabor Stier My question President Putin Ukraine In past years often talked Ukraine safety Russian gas exports Will Ukrainian flats warm Will Kiev pay gas Are talks gas exports Ukraine underway Was discussed Ukrainian President Berlin Vladimir Putin We concerned happening important energy component Ukraine opinion opinion specialists – worse Ukrainian experts Soviet times single complex – realise going To guarantee uninterrupted supplies Europe necessary pump required amount gas underground gas storage facilities This gas transit domestic consumption This technological gist done Soviet times The amount gas facilities low It’s enough It necessary load billion I think billion loaded Moreover already started syphon These grounds concern I discussed gas shipments Ukraine Ukrainian President initiative He wanted know whether Russia could resume deliveries Of course anytime Nothing required We contract annex Only one thing necessary advance payment We provide timely guaranteed energy supplies Ukrainian consumers amount advance payment But today price Ukraine – agreed said last year – higher price neighbours instance Poland I know current prices conversation Poland buying gas us per thousand cubic metres accordance contractual commitments still valid We could sell gas Ukraine I mentioned price – per thousand cubic metres gas But told prefer reverse supplies By way violation Gazprom’s contracts partners Western Europe turning blind eye showing understanding If prefer reverse supplies okay let get far I know cost gas end users – industrial enterprises – already topped per thousand cubic metres We sell gas want buy us yet I reason believe middlemen reverse deals close certain executives Ukraine’s fuel energy complex Good luck let importantly must guarantee transit European countries Question I question INF Treaty lot pressure today I sure aware lots bitter mutual recriminations In regard important understand Russia’s general approach treaty Does Russia see value treaty yes exactly Is even worthwhile part treaty Vladimir Putin It would great value us countries followed Russia United States Here’s naive former Russian leadership went ahead eliminated intermediaterange landbased missiles The Americans eliminated Pershing missiles scrapped SS missiles There tragic event associated chief designer systems committed suicide believing betrayal national interests unilateral disarmament Why unilateral Because treaty eliminated ground complex treaty include mediumrange sea airbased missiles Air seabased missiles affected The Soviet Union simply United States kept service What ultimately got clear imbalance United States kept mediumrange missiles It matter whether based sea air land however Soviet Union simply left without type weapons Almost neighbours make weapons including countries east borders Middle Eastern countries well whereas none countries sharing borders United States neither Canada Mexico manufacture weapons So us special test nevertheless believe necessary honour treaty All since may aware also mediumrange sea airbased missiles Vladimir Putin Yes course I fully agree least try break vicious circle But first start drawing Quite contrary opened completely mids We expected equal dialogue interests would respected would discuss issues meet halfway It impossible offer unilateral solutions press towards goal costs You mentioned bombing former Yugoslavia Crimea Thank example wonderful said The bombing Belgrade intervention carried violation international law Did UN Security Council pass resolution military intervention Yugoslavia No It unilateral decision United States Now tell meant mentioned Crimea What Yugoslavia split several republics including Kosovo separated states Serbia In Kosovo parliament voted secession end hostilities intervention thousands casualties But made decision accepted There hostilities Crimea bombing raids casualties No one died The thing ensure free expression people way strict compliance UN Charter We almost Kosovo In Kosovo parliament approved secession resolution people Crimea expressed opinion referendum After parliament ratified decision Crimea independent state asked reintegrated Russia Of course keep exchanging caustic remarks I think vicious circle must broken I said I prepared say Yugoslavia Iraq Libya Afghanistan NATO’s expansion – And promises forgotten provoked protecting interests “aggressive” Russia accused Why provoking us taking action protect interests Let us negotiate solutions instead But impossible agree anything And even agree something agreements implemented I would like different relations next US administration partnership based mutual respect other’s interests SF Source Paul

       " 'When takes question whether President Obamas immigration executive actions constitutional Supreme Court throw typical playbook United States v Texas one — — important cases highest court term Its certainly important immigration case Supreme Court taken generation arguably century And Court treating accordingly On Monday instead splitting minutes oral arguments two sides case usually happens Court convene minutes — bring parties argue case Texas states suing get minutes The federal government get But Supreme Court also given minutes lawyer representing group immigrant women whod benefit Obamas executive actions And thats — minutes go US House Representatives thanks Republican House majority jumped support states The unusually complicated oral argument process reflects messy case Its case covering surprisingly narrowsounding legal questions outcome carries broad implications relationship Congress president relationship federal government states Oh yeah — presidential election year immigration Court become election issues All makes something nightmare scenario Chief Justice John Roberts tends anxious typical Supreme Court justice present Courts opinions drawn purely law rather politics As justices hear oral arguments consider case issuing opinion theyre expected late June end term Roberts justices work legal questions less contentious abstract broader immigration debate makes seem Then theyll figure theres way cobble together fivevote majority lasting opinion — eightperson Court deadlock putting important case Courts term limbo creating opportunity chaos In November President Obama issued series memos declaring executive actions immigration Two issue case One memo expanded existing Deferred Action Childhood Arrivals program DACA since allowed immigrants whod come US children apply temporary protection deportation work permits The one added new deferred action program — Deferred Action Parents Americans program — would allowed millions unauthorized immigrants US citizen permanent resident children apply deportation protection work permits well The two actions usually referred DAPADACA Since states lower courts put hold since first ruling issued February The original DACA program however still place isnt challenged suit To prevent confusion Ill refer DAPA instead DAPADACA talking actions Federal immigration enforcement totally transformed past years More people eligible deportation ever The growth unauthorized population pre–Great Recession meant people deport After government got vastly money resources deportation And deportations escalated accordingly — high first several years Obama administration President Obama spent time office trying impose sort control — make sure government choosing whos important deport rather arbitrarily deporting anyone Immigration Customs Enforcement agents get hands His first attempts — setting high low priorities deportation telling immigration agents follow — something sides current court case agree could rankandfile immigration agents frequently ignored favor judgment So President Obama created first deferred action program DACA — allowing people proactively apply protection deportation rather simply hoping ICE followed memo deport Its solidly effective After comprehensive immigration reform stalled Congress pressure grew Obama use tool worked — deferred action — protect groups lowpriority immigrants DAPA expanded DACA DAPA supposed program ensured Obamas legacy immigration turning deporter chief first term man brought immigrants shadows If Supreme Court lets program go forward legacy assured If strikes DAPA Obamas legacy — immigrants attitude toward Democratic Party — ambivalent disappointing one United States v Texas political origins That doesnt mean states sued Obama administration wrong merits — acknowledgment circumstances around cases genesis shortly Obama announced executive actions There wasnt serious legal challenge original DACA program even though many criticisms DAPA case would applied DACA well But June country middle general election campaign Republican nominee trying run toward center appeal Latinos In November hand relatively unpopular President Obama responding electoral defeat midterm elections — including loss Senate — executive actions issue mobilized GOP base The states side case lined along partisan lines The Texas suit involves states — three unified Republican control — well four Republican governors three Democratic attorneys general wouldnt let state officially join case one Republican attorney general The states filed briefs supporting Obama administration meanwhile represent twothirds states Democratic attorneys general Texas leading coalition states bringing lawsuit two reasons One offered persuasive case DAPA could actually hurt state later Two houses Southern District Texas court states chose file case presumably knew theyd good chance The administration allies implied unfair happens time They chose wisely In February — days government scheduled start accepting applications expanded DACA — Judge Andrew Hanen issued injunction preventing government moving ahead program logic states likely prevail claims The Fifth Circuit Court Appeals upheld injunction And January Supreme Court agreed hear case As case made way courts gotten much broader Initially injunction based narrow claim Obama administration hadnt used right procedure instituting DAPA The Fifth Circuit ruled DAPA also least likely illegal merits And Supreme Court added constitutional question whether DAPA violates take care clause Constitution While theoretically still ruling injunction Supreme Court dealing merits case — ensuring majority Courts eight justices side Obama administration states case finished DAPA alive dead duration Obamas time office The stakes risen accordingly The House Representatives asked granted chance argue DAPA violates laws Congress passed — something isnt totally unheard Supreme Court level certainly raises political temperature case And federal governments side argument behalf Jane Doe immigrant women — mention likely presence many potential DAPA beneficiaries Supreme Court oral arguments — inevitably remind justices question balance separation powers immigrants Because immigration divisive culture war issue — phrases like enforce law get tossed around frequently talking points — sure seems like case massive legal dispute happen unauthorized immigrants US But There four questions play case given importance case relatively narrow Is even legal Texas sue federal government stop DAPA program The states case one sentence It costs state government money give subsidized drivers licenses DAPA recipients qualify The federal governments case one sentence If took state sue federal government policy didnt like courts would clogged forever The first question Court address whether Texas states standing — whether legally able bring lawsuit In order show standing Texas show implementing DAPA causes direct harm state Even substance Texass legal argument DAPA correct cant show standing whole suit gets dismissed — allowing DAPA go effect This route would give Supreme Court appealing options well get bit The Republican governors state attorneys general Texass side case clearly think allowing unauthorized immigrants remain states harmful sorts reasons But often case Supreme Court cases — definitely case one — actual argument put forward courtroom lot narrower argument whether unauthorized immigrants good bad America thats happening around case So far courts found states standing single reason Texas drivers license costs Under Texas law people get deferred action eligible drivers licenses — fees partially cover cost producing license state government covers rest cost DAPA would make hundreds thousands Texans eligible apply drivers licenses first time would cost state money The Supreme Court decide whether thats enough reason allow Texas states sue federal government entire policy The federal government argues President Obamas fault Texas law would allow DAPA recipients get drivers licenses Furthermore supporters federal governments side case argue theres slippery slope Allow states sue government policy dont like long show costs state something even cost recouped courts clogged lawsuits left right Theyre hoping possibility scare Chief Justice Roberts dissented previous case states suing federal government Massachusetts v EPA protecting Supreme Courts legacy remaining dispute Is DAPA substantive new regulation — Obama administration didnt follow proper procedure The federal governments argument one sentence Nope general statement policy time The states argument one sentence It sets pretty hardandfast standards qualifies deferred action work authorization seems pretty rulelike This question also seems pretty narrow — challenge whether Obama administration DAPA right way instead whether right thing So might get lot Supreme Courts attention But actually basis original ruling freezing DAPA issued February Judge Hanen Fifth Circuit Under Administrative Procedures Act government cant issue new regulatory rules propose allow certain period public response Hence term notice comment comes bunch people discussing aspect Supreme Court case The Obama administration didnt DAPA It argues didnt wasnt real rule general guideline The states disagree At root disagreement deferred action programs actually work whether immigration agents actually leeway reject applications reason policylike whether Obama administration dictated anyone meets standards get protection rulelike And DAPA hasnt gone effect yet really argument original DACA program working — even though existing deferred action program isnt challenged case Is DAPA within presidents authority encroach parts immigration law Congress already set rules The federal governments argument one sentence DAPA way tell immigrants theyre deported — something sides agree legal The states argument one sentence DAPA goes beyond bestowing lawful presence work permits immigrants Congress didnt want grant either one Legally biggest question DAPA Does violate US law going beyond president allowed immigration But disagreement two sides actual court case lot narrower youd think given general heatedness immigration debate US immigration law gives president lot latitude make policy decisions — gets lot areas So states case agree President Obama rest executive branch latitude choose deport deport The states even say would okay Obama administration issued cards people low priorities deportation indicating low priorities But say DAPA goes beyond president allowed crosses areas Congress set firm rules immigration two ways It allows deferred action recipients apply work permits states argue violates Congresss intent allow unauthorized immigrants work legally US And say DAPA deems people lawfully present US even though Congress said illegal The phrase lawful presence probably going thrown around lot Mondays oral arguments — become increasingly central states argument The federal government argues states simply getting confused Lawful presence isnt thing lawful status immigration law — doesnt grant anyone right US The federal government started arguing really like tolerated presence Is Obama abandoning constitutional obligation take care enforce Congresss laws implementing DAPA The federal governments argument one sentence Nope The states argument one sentence Yep This question wasnt even considered lower courts — Supreme Court added case It centers Constitutions take care clause He shall take Care Laws faithfully executed There isnt lot Supreme Court jurisprudence phrase actually charges president interesting Court felt particularly appropriate — though entirely possible justice interested Antonin Scalia surviving justices dont interest The answer take care question depends whether DAPA violates US law begin If federal government right DAPA within presidents legal authority hes abandoning duty execute laws implementing If states right DAPA illegal Obama might violating take care clause implementing — program would struck event For people believe President Obama legally obligated deport unauthorized immigrants circumstances idea hes violating constitution taking care enforce immigration laws appeal But neither side actually arguing court There dozens hypothetical possible answers Court could reach four questions But terms cases practical outcome essentially four options Furthermore — things get really messy — absence Supreme Court opinion could allow another circuit court hear case DAPA rule could go forward How lawsuit would proceed unclear maybe states sided Obama administration could find standing But would create situation DAPA legal parts country illegal others Its entirely possible Supreme Court would go way avoid level chaos Thats analysts think likely outcome If Court sides states nothing changes — programs currently arent effect wont go effect But Court sides administration estimated million immigrants currently vulnerable deportation get three years protection ability work US legally The effects could lives immigrants families could huge The evidence DACA protected immigrants past three half years promising Threequarters DACA recipients able get betterpaying jobs percent gone back school percent said could help support families Theres evidence DACA helps keep immigrants integrated American life — instead losing interest school career feel immigration status holds back If Supreme Court reinstates DAPA end June Obama administration seven months left office process applications — many community groups would able help people get applications busy mobilizing election Furthermore election might discourage immigrants wanting sign begin — theyre worried Donald Trump president come theyll much less inclined turn personal information government DAPA Obama administration initiative Theres nothing stopping next president ending program rescinding protections even Supreme Court upholds year Ted Cruz Donald Trump already promised first days office That doesnt mean immigrants gotten deferred action far would necessarily get deported In fact thats bigger decision President Cruz Trump would make database hundreds thousands immigrants unauthorized definition welleducated speak English least kids US citizens A President Trump might start mass deportation campaign targeting immigrants easily locate former deferred action recipients Some pundits argued means real immigration fight happens November rather happens courts spring Insofar next president choose whether end deferred action thats true But Supreme Court decision could definitely shape options president expand Hillary Clinton Bernie Sanders promised Sanders explicitly said hed protect million people using deferred action Clinton said wouldnt deport immigrants hadnt committed crimes hasnt explained shed protect If Supreme Court strikes DAPA — upholds articulates limiting principle clarifies president — plans lot harder implement Democratic president would even pressure find way protect immigrants That could create trouble Conservatives siding states United States v Texas argue Obama wins case theres limit could protected deportation They make persuasive case The Obama administration argues DAPA legal wouldnt legal give deferred action even immigrants — say parents DACA recipients But reasoning point fairly weak doesnt help candidates partys presidential nomination promising This lack limiting principle gives conservatives lot pause A president could whatever likes whole host issues — say refuse enforce environmental regulations even declare tax cut executive fiat Voxs Andrew Prokop lays options Hypotheticals like raise valid concerns use prosecutorial discretion generally But issues existing law clear ruling feds case would make worse Many legal scholars believe immigration law simply gives president discretion areas law So ruling Obama case wouldnt necessarily create precedent issues If president historically lot leeway set immigration policy though ruling states would effectively constrain power The states case arent asking Supreme Court issue broad ruling But doesnt stop Court wants And Court finds illegal president allow large group immigrants apply work permits definitely calls original DACA program question — raises questions uses executive power immigrations well An extremely broad ruling president could even dictate executive branch cant declare immigrants low priorities deportation though thats extremely unlikely But even relatively narrow ruling states would implications issues president didnt much leeway begin Its possible imagine Supreme Court ruling Obama whose argument implicitly called question things hes done delaying employer mandate modifying key provisions No Child Left Behind mention original DACA program It wouldnt automatically strike could open door future court challenges What legal scholars side administration particularly concerned though happen Texas states granted standing — even Court ultimately sides Obama They argue would essentially invite states sue federal government policy dont like hunt way policy harms In amicus brief example law professor Walter Dellinger argues states could start suing IRS organizations exempt federal taxes To certain extent states anyway — state ever sued federal government something state likes But Supreme Court long tried avoid becoming way states challenge federal policy willynilly Thats sort politics tends want stay Then lesson United States v Texas may well even politics stop Supreme Court door cases come — happens decisions come — political start finish',\n",

Hillary Clinton declared winner state Texas election night full investigation voting machines conducted way Donald Trump lose state I said greatest miracle US political history Donald Trump wins election without state Texas Donald Trump exactly zero chance winning So living Texas need keep reporting anything unusual see hear go vote Most Americans don’t realize exact thing happening last presidential election The state Ohio considered key Mitt Romney’s chances winning right election day Romney campaign actually believed going win state Unfortunately Romney something funny going voting machines In previous article I included Quote Ohio voter vote switched Mitt Romney Barack Obama three times … “I don’t know happened anybody else first time years voted ever happened me” said Marion Ohio voter Joan Stevens Stevens said voted took three tries machine accepted choice vote Romney “I went vote I got right middle Romney’s name” Stevens told Fox News saying certain put finger directly choice White House She said first time pushed “Romney” machine marked “Obama” So pushed Romney Obama came Then happened third time “Maybe make mistake three times” told Fox News And see strange numbers come certain areas Ohio four years ago For example precincts Cuyahoga County Barack Obama got least percent vote If happened one precinct would odd enough But odds happening precincts one county random chance low aren’t even worth mentioning And course didn’t happen Ohio Similar things happening country The reason I bring show pattern If fair vote conducted Romney may indeed appears

understand exists Most people today conditioned perceive events misinterpreted standpoint “Occam’s Razor”— wrongly assume simplest explanation probably right one In fact Occam’s Razor states Instead summarize states simplest explanation GIVEN THE EVIDENCE hand probably right explanation It well known documented decades push globalism deliberate focused effort part select “elite” international financiers central bankers political leaders numerous members exclusive think tanks They often openly admit goals total globalization publications perhaps believing uneducated commoners would never read anyway Carroll Quigley mentor Bill Clinton member Council Foreign Relations often quoted open admissions general scheme The powers financial capitalism farreaching aim nothing less create world system financial control private hands able dominate political system country economy world whole This system controlled feudalist fashion central banks world acting concert secret agreements arrived frequent meetings conferences The apex systems Bank International Settlements Basel Switzerland private bank owned controlled world’s central banks private corporations Each central bank… sought dominate government ability control Treasury loans manipulate foreign exchanges influence level economic activity country influence cooperative politicians subsequent economic rewards business world – Carroll Quigley Tragedy And Hope The people behind effort enforce globalism tied together particular ideology perhaps even cultlike religion envision world order described Plato’s Republic They believe “chosen” either fate destiny genetics rule philosopher kings rest us They believe wisest capable humanity offer evolutionary means create chaos order thin air mold society This mentality evident systems build exploit For example central banking general nothing mechanism driving nations debt currency devaluation ultimately enslavement widespread economic extortion The end game central banks I believe triggering historic financial crisis used elites leverage promote complete global centralization viable solution This process destabilizing economies societies directed heads various central banks Instead directed even central global institutions like International Monetary Fund Bank International Settlements outlined revealing mainstream articles like “ Ruling The World Of Money “published Harper’s Magazine We also find words globalists campaign “new world order” meant voluntary … When struggle seems drifting definitely towards world social democracy may still great delays disappointments becomes efficient beneficent world system Countless people … hate new world order … die protesting When attempt evaluate promise bear mind distress generation malcontents many quite gallant gracefullooking people – HG Welles Fabian Socialist author The New World Order In short ‘house world order’ built bottom rather f rom top It look like great ‘booming buzzing confusion’ use

April issue Foreign Affairs The New World Order cannot happen without US participation single significant component Yes New World Order force United States change perceptions – Henry Kissinger World Action Council April I could quote globalists day long I think get general idea While people see globalism “natural offshoot” free markets inevitable outcome economic progress reality simplest explanation given evidence hand globalism outright war waged ideal sovereign peoples nations It guerrilla war fourth generation warfare waged small group elites rest us A significant element war concerns nature borders Borders nations states even towns villages lines map invisible barriers dirt This elites mainstream media would like us believe Instead borders applied correctly represent principles least supposed function Human beings natural community builders constantly seeking others likemind likepurpose understand subconsciously groups individuals working together often always accomplish That said human beings also natural tendency value individual freedom right voluntary association We like forced associate people groups hold similar values Cultures erect borders frankly people right vet wish join participate endeavors People also right discriminate anyone share core values words right refuse association groups ideologies destructive Interestingly globalists mouthpieces argue refusing associate might undermine values WE violating THEIR rights See works Globalists exploit word “isolationism” shame sovereignty champions eyes public shame isolation principles freedom speech expression right self defense line There also nothing wrong isolating prosperous economic model unsuccessful economic models Forcing decentralized free market economy adopt feudal administration central banking government eventually destroy model Forcing free market economy fiscal interdependency socialist economies also likely undermine culture Just importing millions people differing values feed nation socialism thrust upon recipe collapse The point values social structures mutually exclusive matter hard try certain cultures never homogenized cultures You eliminate one culture make room borderless world This globalists seek achieve It greater purpose behind open border policies globalization – annihilate ideological competition humanity thinks option elitist religion The ultimate end game globalists control governments governments nothing tool Rather end game obtain total psychological influence eventually consent masses Variety choice removed environment order globalism work nice way say many people die many principles erased public consciousness The elites assert concept single world culture pinnacle principle mankind longer need borders principle superior As long borders concept continue exist always chance separate different ideals rising compete globalist philosophy This unacceptable elites This led subtle propaganda meme cultures value sovereignty globalism somehow seething cauldrons potential evil Today rising tide antiglobalist movements argument mainstream “populists” conservatives lower uneducated class dangerous element set topple “peace prosperity” afforded globalist hands In words treated like children scrawling finger paints across finely crafted Mona Lisa Once Carroll Quigley promotes predicts propaganda decades advance discusses need “working within system” change instead fighting For example I’ve talked lower middle class backbone fascism future I think may happen The party members Nazi Party Germany

measure political power next year pull plug international fiscal life support blame us resulting tragedy There modicum evidence support notion globalization interdependency centralization actually work One need examine economic immigration nightmare present EU understand So globalists argue world actually centralized ENOUGH That’s right claim need globalization less solve world’s ailments In meantime principles sovereignty historically demonized — concept separate cultures built separate beliefs psychologically equated evil future generations Otherwise globalists never able successfully establish global system without borders Imagine moment era far away principle sovereignty considered abhorrent racist violent poisonous individual would shamed even punished collective entertaining notion Imagine world sovereignty conservatism held next generation new “original sins” dangerous ideas almost brought extinction man This mental prison globalists want take us We break free would require complete reversal way participate society Meaning need rebellion voluntary associations A push decentralization instead globalization Thousands upon thousands voluntary groups focusing localization self reliance true production We must act build system based redundancy instead fragile interdependency We need go back age many borders less borders every individual free participate whatever social group endeavor believes best well free defend people seek sabotage voluntary tribal society devoid forced associations Of course effort would require unimaginable sacrifice fight would

       " 'Archives Michael On Television Reasons Why Starting World War In The Middle East Is A Really Bad Idea By Michael Snyder August th While country obsessing Miley Cyrus Obama administration preparing military attack Syria potential starting World War In fact reported cruise missile strikes could begin “ early Thursday “ The Obama administration pledging strikes “limited” happens Syrians fight back What happens sink US naval vessel agents start hitting targets inside United States Then would fullblown war hands And happens Syrians decide retaliate hitting Israel If Syrian missiles start raining Tel Aviv Israel extremely tempted absolutely flatten Damascus capable precisely And course Hezbollah Iran likely sit idly close ally Syria battered oblivion We looking scenario entire Middle East could set aflame might beginning Russia China sternly warning US government get involved Syria starting war Syria extraordinary amount damage relationships two global superpowers Could beginning chain events could eventually lead massive global conflict Russia China one side United States Of course happen immediately I fear happening setting stage really bad things The following reasons starting World War Middle East really bad idea… The American people overwhelmingly going war Syria… Americans strongly oppose US intervention Syria’s civil war believe Washington stay conflict even reports Syria’s government used deadly chemicals attack civilians confirmed ReutersIpsos poll says About percent Americans surveyed said United States intervene Syria’s civil war percent thought President Barack Obama act At point war Syria even unpopular American people Congress The Obama administration gotten approval go war Syria Congress US Constitution requires The United States approval United Nations attack Syria going getting Syria said use “ means available ” defend United States attacks Would include terror attacks United States Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem made following statement Tuesday … “We two options either surrender defend means disposal The second choice best defend ourselves” Russia sent advanced antiship missiles Syria What think would happen images sinking US naval vessels come flashing across television screens When United States attacks Syria good chance Syria attack Israel Just check one Syrian official said recently … A member Syrian Ba’ath national council Halef alMuftah recently Syrian propaganda minister’s aide said Monday Damascus views Israel “behind aggression therefore come fire” Syria attacked United States In interview American radio station Sawa Arabic President Bashar Assad’s fellow party member said “We strategic weapons retaliate Essentially strategic weapons aimed Israel” AlMuftah stressed US’s threats influence Syrain regime added “If US Israel err aggression exploit chemical issue region go endless flames affecting area’s security world’s” If Syria attacks Israel consequences could absolutely catastrophic Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promising attack responded “ forcefully “… “We party civil war Syria identify attempt attack us respond respond forcefully” Hezbollah likely whatever fight survival Assad regime That could include striking targets inside United States Israel Iran’s closest ally Syria Will Iran sit idly closest ally removed chessboard Starting war Syria cause significant damage relationship Russia On Tuesday Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin said West acting like “ monkey hand grenade “ Starting war Syria cause significant damage relationship China And happen Chinese decide start dumping massive amount US debt holding Interest rates would absolutely skyrocket would rapidly facing nightmare scenario Dr Jerome Corsi Walid Shoebat compiled startling evidence actually Syrian rebels US supporting responsible chemical weapons attack used justification go war Syria… With assistance former PLO member native Arabicspeaker Walid Shoebat WND assembled evidence various Middle Eastern sources cast doubt Obama administration claims Assad government responsible last week’s attack You examine evidence right As Pat Buchanan recently noted would made absolutely sense Assad regime use chemical weapons defenseless women children The people would benefit attack would rebels… The basic question needs asked horrific attack civilians appears gas related Cui bono To whose benefit would use nerve gas Syrian women children redound Certainly Assad’s see furor threats use gas produced The sole beneficiary apparent use poison gas civilians rebelheld territory appears rebels long sought us come fight war If Saudis really want topple Assad regime They expect United States dirty work A former commander US Central Command said US attack Syria would result “ fullthroated serious war “ A war Middle East bad financial markets The Dow points today concern war Syria primary reason A war Middle East cause price oil go On Tuesday price US oil rose barrel There way world US government backing Syrian rebels As I discussed days ago rebels pledged loyalty alQaeda beheaded numerous Christians massacred entire Christian villages If US government helps lunatics take power Syria complete utter disaster A lot innocent civilians inside Syria end getting killed Already lot Syrians expressing concern “foreign intervention” mean families… “I’ve always supporter foreign intervention seems like reality I’ve worrying family could hurt killed” said one woman Zaina opposes Assad “I’m afraid military strike now” “The big fear they’ll make mistakes made Libya Iraq” said Ziyad man s “They’ll hit civilian targets they’ll cry mistake we’ll get killed thousands” If US government insists going war Syria without approval American people US Congress United Nations going lose lot friends lot credibility around globe It truly sad day Russia looks like “the good guys” look like “the bad guys” What good could possibly come getting involved Syria As I wrote day “rebels” Obama backing rabidly antiChristian rabidly antiIsrael rabidly antiwestern If take control Syria nation far unstable far hotbed terrorism And downside getting involved Syria absolutely enormous Syria Iran Hezbollah agents inside country decide start blowing stuff wake American people horror war really quick And attacking Syria United States could cause major regional war erupt Middle East could eventually lead World War I don’t know I think starting World War Middle East really bad idea Let us hope cooler heads prevail things spin totally control It Is

       " 'Parts Of Patriot Act Expire Even As Senate Moves On Bill Limiting Surveillance It dramatic day floor United States Senate Sunday Unable overcome parliamentary maneuvers Sen Rand Paul body adjourned let three controversial provisions Patriot Act expire midnight Trying beat midnight deadline rare Sunday session Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell tried fast track House bill would overhaul governments bulk collection Americans phone records At around pm ET House bill cleared key procedural hurdle sun set Washington became clear Senate rule allowing hours debate would force parts Patriot Act expire least temporarily The Patriot Act expire tonight Paul Kentucky Republican led charge governments bulk collection program said But temporary They ultimately get way Before session Paul promised use parliamentary moves available force Senate vote measure happen deadline He warned lawmakers sides aisle putting country risk To go dark risk Americans lives Sen Dan Coats Indiana Republican said floor Senate McConnell senior Republican senator Kentucky said blocking legislation worrying country McConnell said even though vehemently opposed bill previously — chamber also failed move forward earlier week — would attempt pass We shouldnt disarming unilaterally enemies grow sophisticated aggressive certainly based campaign demagoguery disinformation launched wake unlawful actions Edward Snowden McConnell said Paul fired back saying worried House bill actually made government better collecting phone records bulk He said couldnt trust secret court tasked interpreting law wanted add amendments bill He added US using fear convince Americans need programs country already tools fight terrorists They could seek warrants said instead dragging Americans said unconstitutional surveillance system Mark words said battle At around pm ET lengthy break McConnell took floor admitted defeat He offered several amendments House bill adjourned pm ET June guaranteeing parts surveillance programs instituted US terrorist attacks Sept would end entirely least temporarily In statement White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Senate taken important—if late—step forward tonight The White House always supported HR — also known Houses USA Freedom Act The bill ends bulk collection program know If passed government would still access data would query databases kept phone companies We call Senate ensure irresponsible lapse authorities shortlived possible Earnest said On matter critical national security individual Senators must put aside partisan motivations act swiftly The American people deserve nothing less Well liveblogged Senate action happened Keep reading want playbyplay Update pm ET The Most Dramatic Moment Well leave tonight video dramatic moment night It happened Sen Rand Paul tried get five minutes speak Heres video via Real Clear Politics Paul way goes win parliamentary tousle finally getting five minutes The Senate adjourned Three provisions Patriot Act expire least temporarily Update pm ET Senate Still In Session The Senate still technically session A senator suggested absence quorum given Senate time figure happen next Update pm ET Strong Support For Comprehensive Reform In statement Michael MacleodBall acting director ACLU Washington Legislative Office said todays vote likely temporary end bulk collection program reflection strong support meaningful comprehensive reform surveillance laws He added Congress take advantage sunset pass far reaching surveillance reform instead weak bill currently consideration Update pm ET What To Expect So stand right The Senate ability move House bill senators debate bill hours Manu Raju Politico reports Majority Leader McConnell plans employ prerogative Reid rarely used Making senators actually debate postcloture time — hell continue process Congressional Quarterly reports McConnell spokesman said likely votes tonight This means three provisions Patriot Act likely lapse temporarily Update pm ET Bulk Collection Will Likely Lapse Wyden Sen Martin Heinrich Democrat New Mexico still talking floor Its worth noting according White House officials briefed reporters last week likely lapse governments bulk collection program As reported While statutory deadline Monday June senior administration officials said begin winding surveillance programs pm ET Sunday That process said could aborted late pm ET We past window Sen Ron Wyden Democrat Oregon finished speech floor Wyden longtime critic bulk collection program During speech reminded Americans administration misled Congress past He specifically referring hearing asked National Intelligence Director James Clapper National Security Agency collects type data millions hundreds millions Americans Clapper answered No sir adding wittingly Clapper ended apologizing answer Wyden said thats Senate ask hard questions It job ask hard questions Wyden said Update pm ET What Does The House Bill Contain Weve noted Pauls reservations HR — Houses USA Freedom Act From previous post heres bill would Update pm ET Patriot Act Will Expire Sen Paul said The Patriot Act expire tonight But temporary They ultimately get way With Paul stepped floor Heres quick recap said Update pm ET Bill Will Ultimately Pass Sen Rand Paul took floor shortly cloture vote passed He conceded House bill would ultimately pass tonight begins process ending bulk collection His issue House bill said Congress may replacing one bulk collection program another Its hard trust people giving great power Paul said The senator Kentucky said would offer amendments bill Update pm ET Procedural Vote Passes By Large Margin The procedural measure move onto House bill ultimately passed large margin — It means Senate overcome major procedural hurdle senator still debate measure hours The votes still coming Senate reached votes needed limit debate move House bill However Paul senator matter force Senate debate matter another hours vote bill That course many hours midnight deadline The vote far favor cloture opposed With temporary extension table Sen McConnell said two options One let programs expire Two try pass House bill The first option said completely unacceptable So said would move forward reconsideration House bill That motion passed voice vote Senate voting limit debate move House bill Thats also known cloture vote As Foxs Chad Pergram reports Twitter doesnt mean much even get votes needed cloture Paul still require hrs burn clock Senate get Hses NSA bill Means pgms would lapse Update pm ET McConnell Proposes To Extend Two Sections Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell took floor propose limited bill — one would extend Sections socalled roving wiretaps lone wolf provisions Just like Paul objected McConnell said objection worrying Americans The nature threat serious McConnell said therefore disarming unilaterally The Senate reconvened Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell floor Update pm ET The Debate So Far While wait Senate reconvene heres little recap weve heard floor far Democratic Sens Harry Reid Patrick Leahy made case Senate act quickly pass House bill Leahy said passed House bipartisan fashion makes significant changes governments surveillance programs Reid said important national security program He said CIA Director John Brennan even Senate Republicans agree allowing parts law expire would threaten national security In words big time stuff In five minutes Sen Paul essentially scoffed notion How protect asked What using Constitution What getting warrant Update pm ET What To Expect Right Senate recess Both parties meeting discuss go forward When Senate returns expect series votes reconsider HR — also known Houses USA Freedom Act The Senate already failed move measure forward earlier month It take long drama get started About hour session Sen Rand Paul asked speak five minutes Sen Chuck Grassley fellow Republican shot Sen John McCain another fellow Republican suggested Paul learn rules Senate Thats Paul called live quorum — roll call determines whether majority Senate chamber continue business To speed things live quorum

background If elected Trump deal losses personal business executive branch litigation Trump’s particularly bombastic he’d terms national security He insists he’d target wives children terrorists – deliberate killing civilian bystanders Former CIA director Michael Hayden said Trump orders action US military would likely refuse setting dispute could spiral constitutional crisis Trump also said numerous times would reinstitute waterboarding terror suspects “worse” “That’s really troubling thing Waterboarding torture pretty clear And waterboarding torture violates criminal law” says Chris Edelson assistant professor government American University Washington author “Power Without Constraint The Post Presidency National Security” As Trump’s proposed ban Muslim immigrants entering US may – may – pass constitutional muster Traditionally executive branch broad latitude set immigration regulations However Supreme Court might look askance ban particular religious group even applied people outside US according Professor Edelson It’s uncharted legal territory And Congress might weigh After GOP lawmakers House Speaker Paul Ryan said oppose ban “Trump could try act Congress would put weak footing” notes Edelson Trump’s bombast put many nominal Republican supporters difficult position For years GOP lawmakers accusing Mr Obama abusing office bypassing Congress party’s presumptive

can’t “He’ll White House counsel” says Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Well maybe The job White House counsel isn’t primarily point limits presidential authority It’s figure legal

Constitution enforce itself” says Edelson American University That turn could depend domestic political international security situation facing nation moment Consider World War II President Franklin Roosevelt facing grave threat decided would OK go ahead imprison JapaneseAmericans internment camps He issued executive order effect Today seems pretty clearly unconstitutional probably But US citizens accepted due nature times That’s civil liberties danger associated national security fears Power flows Oval Office danger passed power flows back Since presidency changed argues Edelson President George W Bush pioneered sweeping surveillance powers since enacted law Obama intensified nominally secret drone war includes extrajudicial killing American citizens deemed terrorists The

stunned shaking head certainly alone Obviously Sheriff Furlong grasps potential perils black market trade — wholly fails recognize removing cannabis’ illegality would thus remove risk violence When State removed consensual business transactions individuals free conduct trade see fit — cannabis abundant legal would highly unlikely people would continue killing soured deals But Furlong’s

Venus weird day It longer year Venus full hydrocarbons carbon dioxide It atmosphere much thicker Earth’s All sort lend credit theory It volcanic hot surface In astronomers guessing Venus twin Earth slightly higher temperature Possibly equator comfortable poles Then Russian Drones sent Venus told entirely different story blew astronomers water I hope I embarrassing efforts ban man publication He

new oil reserves The second aspect Venus played kind bounce game came Solar System removed second planet Sun process dumped Solar System He thought Mars originally orbit Venus today His theory mankind forgot happened kind national amnesia IF says true Mars could thick enough atmosphere water support life More important might thick magnetic layer filtered Sun kept planet temperate one time All ruined Venus dragged orbit That might happened biblical times The Earth might slightly closer Sun day year instead quarter day year This course speculation go find real truth going My guess life Mars

degrees orbits gas giants Some extremely comet like orbits least one way Solar System I scientist A lot I read makes little sense current theories Unless something big enough drag small planets moons original orbits around Sun Some think brown dwarf light year edge Sun’s influencegravity So far one found I think looking wrong places IF brown dwarf quite small stars go IF cometlike orbit somewhere road return causing kinds changes Solar System IF planets around planets might cause lot destruction come close existing planets moons solar system Our planets viewed North top Solar System rotate

many year’s polls coverage cringeworthy” wrote Ornstein Abramowitz took issue ReutersIpsos tracking poll showed Clinton point lead May tie five days later sixpoint lead Clinton May They questioned whether opinions could shifted much time “when major events” campaign They challenged online NBCSurveyMonkey poll showed Trump within three points Clinton said Trump receiving percent Hispanic vote “most surveys shown Mr Trump eking percent among Latino voters” They also raised doubts trio Quinnipiac polls battleground states Florida Ohio Pennsylvania arguing samples used surveys “whiter states ” exit polls “When polling aficionados see results seem surprising unusual first instinct look hood things like demographic partisan distributions” wrote “When cable news hosts talking heads see kinds

Yeah I get I wouldnt want run Congress either I know youre probably reasonable person nuanced thinker bit independent streak You dont want get drawn maw tribal trench warfare DC swamp Its bitter angry

happening bit days Which takes us upcoming congressional election Yet another golden opportunity bring fresh talent Washington maybe folks excited governing trying make government disappear altogether If optimism sounds like triumph hope experience probably Which raises important question Why dont get many moderates especially moderate Republicans running office days Ive gathered two good explanations recent political science literature Say youre moderate Republican You might look Republican Party Congress feel like exactly people charge place Youd see leaders Congress tend extremist side youd make reasonable guess wouldnt get far Congress moderate By contrast youre True Conservative youd see opportunity fit right This Party Fit hypothesis developed political scientist Danielle Thomsen paper titled Ideological Moderates Wont Run How Party Fit Matters Partisan Polarization Congress She also forthcoming book Thomsen looked surveys state legislators data actually runs Congress Her conclusion based data simple The liberal Republican state legislator less likely run Congress conservative Democratic state legislator less likely In email Thomsen told indeed moderates state legislatures She estimates Republican state legislators liberal former Senator Olympia Snowe RME nearly Democratic state legislators conservative former representative John Tanner DTN Its much less likely run Congress Like aspects polarization party fit story asymmetrical — polarizing impact much stronger Republicans Democrats maintained ideological diversity get moderates run This true Republicans And like aspects polarization feeds As Thomsen also wrote email As moderates gradually lost place parties polarization become selfreinforcing The hyperpartisanship Congress discouraged moderates running remaining Congress exacerbated ideological distance parties Again say youre moderate Republican Chances local state party leaders interested encouraging run Most likely ideologues theyd like find people share beliefs especially Republicans They want True Conservatives This conclusion I draw fascinating survey countylevel political party leaders conducted political scientists David Broockman Nicholas Carnes Melody CrowderMeyer Christopher Skovron They asked qualities party leaders wanted Sure party leaders said looked usual things — honesty experience intelligence dedication good looks yes ability raise money But also cared ideology — particularly Republicans Broockman et al write And party leaders play important role candidate recruitment Broockman documented separate paper In pretty much every study trying explain candidates decided run office recruitment major factor Again selfreinforcing loop The ideologues run party going recruit likeminded candidates run office There also probably fundraising aspect Most big donors tend pretty ideological especially right If give lot money almost always feel strongly one two major parties needs charge Active passion strong partisanship tend go together For example explaining leapfrog representation phenomenon extremist candidates jumping median voter district seat changes partisan control political scientists Joseph Bafumi Michael C Herron point active donors tend extreme nondonors They argue may offer one explanation candidates converge middle — cant raise money ideological donors harder run office Sure might argue party leaders may ideologues especially right But want stay power And stay power need win elections And win elections need converge median voter definition middle leftright ideological distribution Ergo moderating pressures electoral competition overcome forces extremism Fair enough In close races party leaders may indeed face tradeoff ideology electability But one problem arent many close races By latest Cook Political Report projections House seats considered safe — thats percent Add likely seats percent low risk So doesnt matter whether parties pick moderates ideologues — theyre almost certainly going win long dont pick convicted felon maybe even In Senate seats solid one party another Cook assessment If add likely seats percent low risk In state legislatures meanwhile percent seats even contested In words proposed moderation median voter theory doesnt many seats work supposed magic But even clear competitive elections actually bring candidates middle Research political scientists Anthony Fowler Andrew B Hall suggests partisans win close congressional elections vote extreme partisans win landslides Fowler Hall conclude Elected officials adapt rollcall voting districts preferences time voters systematically respond replacing incumbents No wonder political scientists Jacob Hacker Paul Pierson described median voter theory failure recent paper criticizing Downsian paradigm Anthony Downs popularized median voter theory As Hacker Pierson conclude Parties fail converge diverge asymmetrically One key reason argue organized interests within parties make strong demands party leaders attentive demands groups provide resources need offering critical financial organizational support Okay youre probably going run Congress Nor I But somebody going put endless fundraising calls invasions privacy negative ads attacking endless recitation platitudinous speeches And especially right somebody probably going ideologue Because else wants run days And else party leaders want recruit The obvious suggestion need get different people running national office — especially right More broadly might want think little pipeline whos

Organization He insisted would able get rid nation’s trillion national debt “over period eight years” Most economists would consider impossible could require taking trillion year annual trillion budget pay holders debt Trump vehemently disagrees “I’m renegotiating deals big trade deals we’re badly With China billion year trade” He said economic growth foresees consequence renegotiated deals would enable United States pay debt — although many economists said exact opposite trade war would crippling US economy Trump also said United States lost standing world would make people “respect

concessions realities political novice saying would pick outsider like vicepresidential running mate rather “somebody walk Senate who’s friendly guys years people years And get things done So I would percent see picking political person opposed somebody outside” In another unprecedented move Trump said plans announce list judges would pick fill vacancies Supreme Court allay concerns conservatives wouldn’t choose someone liking “I’m getting names The Federalist people Some good people The Heritage Foundation” Trump said “I’m going announce judges particular order I’m going put And I’m going guarantee I’m going tell people Because people worried oh maybe he’ll put wrong judge in” And series violent incidents rallies supporters protesters Trump acknowledged least little tried calm things “We’ve purposefully kept crowds past week” said “You know we’ve gone small venues we’re turning away thousands thousands people I hate didn’t want protest You know room people pretty much keep without protesters” The question posed Trump decision run “Where start movie” A wry smile spread face repeated question moment decided turn long flirtation running presidency something real Asked talked critical decision Trump answered “To myself” “To family myself” So interior dialogue “This thought process And I’m saying know look put polls I’m number one” Trump said interest really started pick summer still busy hit NBC reality show “The Apprentice” He kept ambition mostly slowly thinking early last year hired political advisers months formally jumped Trump said experience throughout last two years wasn’t like first made speech New Hampshire “forgot about” soon delivering This time read daily newspapers printedout online articles preferred method reading kept tabs cable news felt pull “I said ‘You know something I really would like do’ I think I’d really well Obviously public seems like me” Trump recalled “I’ll tell moment kicked yes Because monetary moment also There moment I would say February last year would four months three four months I announced Steve Burke great guy Comcast came see top people NBC And wanted extend contract” Trump told going run president instead “I felt many things going wrong country” Trump said thinking time He frustrated saw “stupidity” trade deals Iran nuclear negotiations “terrible” dominated “Persians great negotiators” Trump’s wife Melania heard complaints enthused becoming candidate “She said ‘We great life Why want this’ ” “I said ‘I sort I think I really it’ I could great job” Later Melania said “I hope don’t run you’ll win” according Trump Now year later Republican nomination sight Trump’s family giving different advice “My family said — Don Jr said Ivanka wife said — ‘Be presidential’ ” Trump said getting similar guidance close friends He story share A couple weeks ago friend famous athlete called This right Trump beat Sen Marco Rubio Florida senator’s home state “That big beating Don’t forget face Republican Party He future Republican Party So athlete called And said ‘Hey Donald could us favor We love Don’t kill everybody Because may need way back’ ” But Trump doesn’t see way least yet “I think break egg initially” said adding beat opponents secure nomination willing consider reaching easing way When suggested seems comfortable Lone Ranger — famous oldtime TV radio masked vigilante fought good outside law — Trump immediately concurred “I am” said “Because I understand life And I understand life works I’m Lone Ranger” Asked would build coalition general election Trump responded hasn’t focused Hillary Clinton yet — implication starts attacking voters would rally side Pressed whether incumbent tame anger within party Trump said also “I bring rage I bring rage I always I think I don’t know that’s asset liability whatever I I also bring great unity ultimately I’ve many occasions like people hated human they’ve ever met And it’s end friends And I see happening here” Not everyone though Trump acknowledged “rough” “nasty” debates — much relationships former rivals likely beyond repair “One problems I I hit people I hit harder maybe necessary” said “And it’s almost impossible reel back” Like Rubio former Florida governor Jeb Bush “Some people I competing I’m sure ever go back me” Trump said “I rough Jeb” It “Jeb Low energy Little Marco Names devastating” Trump seemed unsure whether Cruz would ultimately fit category Trump noted gotten along quite well many months suggested could also ambivalent potentially reaching Cruz beats senator Texas nomination “I’ll never call him” get help support Trump said adding Cruz reach would congratulate “Because people beat Okay Which pretty good” Still Trump admitted needed outreach “Honestly lot people calling I calling them” said “Because certain extent I calling shouldn’t calling me” Trump noted two former rivals Ben Carson New Jersey Gov Chris Christie supporting As others “They loved At right time loved” Asked specifically uncertain moment campaign whether “all politics successful politics coalition building” responded “It’s true” “I do” Trump said arms folded across familiar dark suit white shirt red tie sat hopes newest trophy hotel “I agree I agree” Pressed coalition building might begin turned stories boxing great Muhammad Ali football coaching icon Vince Lombardi Ali said earned respect “through goods You know Muhammad Ali friend mine He’s good guy I’ve watched many people years Muhammad Ali would get ring he’d talk talk scream talk ugly bear — know And he’d win And respect winning We don’t win anymore I see — don’t win anymore And he’d win I’ve seen many fighters better Muhammad Ali terms talking I’ve seen guys beautiful flamboyant they’d get ring — they’d get knocked And guess It’s

A friend mine There four players Vince Lombardi walked He angry And grabbed — I young guy — grabbed shirt screaming guy literally And I said wow And I realized way Vince Lombardi got away won” Trump months contended US economy trouble sees overvalued stock market view grown pessimistic late bearish investing point warning Americans “I think we’re sitting economic bubble A financial bubble” Trump said He made clear specifying sector economy economy large asserted bullish forecasts based skewed employment numbers inflated stock market “First we’re percent unemployment We’re number that’s probably twenties look real number” Trump said “That number devised statistically devised make politicians — particular presidents — look good And I wouldn’t getting kind massive crowds I’m getting number real number” The bizarre optimism Donald Trump’s theory economy Trump’s assertion match data Bureau Labor Statistics Its analysis joblessness beyond unemployed — “marginally attached” workers dropped labor force — percent nationally last month Trump’s view also runs counter economists whose rough consensus US economy percent chance slipping recession year largely growth remains weak across world according Wall Street Journal survey economists March Most economists aren’t overly worried imminent downturn job creation remains strong workers starting see wages grow Federal Reserve remains cautious shifting away lowinterestrate stance helped stimulate economy Any number Trump’s predictions haven’t worked In instance predicted Obama reelected oil gas prices would go “through roof like never before” In Trump said Obama’s healthcare law took effect national unemployment would “go even higher” percent He also bullish real estate investments runup housing bust Nonetheless Trump said “it’s precarious times Part reason it’s precarious ripped badly countries We ripped badly China It never ends Nobody’s ever going stop And reason they’re going stop one two They’re either living world makebelieve they’re totally controlled lobbyists special interests” “I’m pessimistic” Trump said “Unless changes made Changes could made” By Trump instance “I fix I fix pretty quickly” Trump firmly believes turnaround trade would necessary beginning solution looming recession He mentions TransPacific Partnership one pact would immediately seek renegotiate putting odds congressional Republicans supported giving president fasttrack trade authority last year Coupled push trade would “very big tax cut” Trump unveiled last September That proposal increases taxes “very rich” reduces taxes taxpayers would cut corporate tax rate percent To woo companies back United States would offer incentive deeply discounted rate would longer allow corporations defer taxes income earned overseas In

times thousand” said shaking head Trump said countries would agree simultaneously would open eliminating nuclear weapons held United States “If it’s done equal basis absolutely” said But Trump added caveat He said much supports idea eliminating nuclear weapons may feasible current climate countries Russia Pakistan perhaps unwilling relinquish arms since “spending tremendous amount money” “That’s something ideal world wonderful I think it’s going happen easily I would love see nuclearfree world Will happen” Trump said “Look Russia right spending tremendous amount money redoing entire nuclear arsenal” Turning Russia’s leader Vladimir Putin Trump said continues appreciate praise Putin even though humanrights record incursions Ukraine elsewhere alarmed many “I want Putin respect country okay” Trump said “I think respects strength Okay I think Putin respects strength And I’ve said I think I get along well Putin Now never know I don’t say — fool would say ‘I will’ I feel I get along

       " 'Donald Trump’s supporters deserve concerns taken seriously If media commentators agree nothing else it’s It’s bit odd meme I remember literally one dwelling importance taking concerns Mitt Romney voters seriously even though made considerably larger share population Trump supporters No one talks taking interests Hillary Clinton supporters still larger group seriously But Trump supporters smaller group backing considerably loathsome agenda received unprecedented outpouring sympathy undertaken sort passiveaggressive snipe unnamed commentators politicians perceived taking concerns seriously “Trumpism part made rest nation eager ignore millions white voters living edges economy” Michelle Cottle worries Atlantic “Many decent sincere people feel disregarded disrespected left behind — ways I feel never felt — disproportionately embrace political opinions I view bigoted paranoid” David Blankenhorn empathizes American Interest “Today’s upscale Americans less less likely even interact much less actually give damn Americans” “Their problems still addressed” Michael Brendan Dougherty writes Week “not elite views virtuous thus deserving help state political class virtue common citizenship” I agree lot The government help people materially struggling Globalization definitely left segments population struggling deserve help White people still economically dominant black Latino Americans basically every way possible suffer poverty But there’s something striking line commentary It doesn’t take stated concerns Trump voters voters similar farright populists abroad seriously slightest The press gotten extremely comfortable describing Trump electorate simply doesn’t exist Cottle describes supporters “white voters living edges economy” This nearly every particular wrong There absolutely evidence Trump’s supporters either primary general election disproportionately poor working class Exit polling primaries found Trump voters made much Ted Cruz voters significantly supporters either Hillary Clinton Bernie Sanders Trump voters FiveThirtyEights Nate Silver found median household income fair bit higher median household income nonHispanic whites America A major study Gallups Jonathan Rothwell confirmed Trump support correlated higher lower income among population whole among white people Trump supporters less likely unemployed dropped labor force Areas manufacturing higher exposure imports China less likely think favorably Trump This shouldn’t surprising Lowerincome whites always likelier support Democrats whites It’d odd Trump singlehandedly reversed longstanding trend American public opinion But suggests image Trump supporters whites economic margins failed elites Washington New York wrong So driving Trump supporters In general election story pretty simple What’s driving support Trump Republican nominee little fewer half voters always vote Republicans Trump getting voters In primary though story colleague Zack Beauchamp explained length almost entirely racial resentment There’s wide array data back UCLAs Michael Tesler found support Trump primaries strongly correlated respondents racial resentment measured survey data Similarly Republican voters lowest opinions Muslims likely vote Trump voters strongly support mass deportation undocumented immigrants likelier support primaries In April Pew Research Center asked Republicans views Trump opinions US becoming majority nonwhite found Republicans thought majority nonwhite population would bad country overwhelmingly favorable views Trump Those thought positive neutral development evenly split Trump By contrast John McCain Mitt Romney got less primary support voters high racial resentment antiimmigration scores less racially resentful antiimmigrant voters Those two primaries lost white nationalist wing Republican Party time wing gaining number As New Americas Lee Drutman found Republicans’ views blacks Latinos plummeted Obama years The white nationalist wing gaining strength due win It got one Trump Even general election support Trump correlated strongly party ID second biggest factor per analysis Hamilton College political scientist Philip Klinkner racial resentment Economic pessimism income level statistically insignificant The message research sends clear There segment Republican Party opposed racial equality It increased numbers reaction election black president The result anti–racial equality candidate Republican nomination Given US one recession away Republican winning presidency concerning development The American press overwhelmingly made leftofcenter white people live large cities internalized strong antiracist norms As result tends composed people think racism serious character defect riddled anxiety perceived touch “real America” “Real America” per decades racially charged tropes culture white nonurban America So comes Donald Trump candidate running open white nationalism whose base whites — economically struggling compared poor whites backing Hillary Clinton way better economically black Latino people backing Clinton — definitely live “real America” journalists feel yearning connect desperately don’t want touch Describing people motivated racial resentment per journalists’ deepseated belief racism major character defect seems cruel unempathetic even it’s supported extensive amounts social scientific research indeed statements Trump’s supporters So becomes tempting ignore evidence insist Trump supporters fact wretched earth connect every possible pathology white America postindustrial decay opioid crisis labor force dropouts rising middleage mortality rates falling social mobility This almost always fails globalization victims labor force dropouts less likely support Trump per Rothwell there’s even small hint connection Rothwell found correlation Trump support living area rising white mortality you’re luck If squint hard enough narrative always survive There’s parallel temptation among leftists social democrats ongoing attempt show neoliberal capitalism failing attempt tie failure rise Trump If economic suffering among lowerclass whites caused Trump reasoning goes solution address suffering generous welfare state better economic policy achieved multiethnic workingclass coalition includes Trump supporters Yes supporters may racist it’s important say mean things lest fall coalition I actually agree current capitalist regime failing We need truly universal health care universal child care universal child allowance basic income programs address

journalists sympathetic Trump supporters I’ve never heard actually proposed Hillary Clinton great credit offered programs ranging expanded child care free college plan fight opioid epidemic child tax

struggles voting candidate would make economic situation far worse much insulting accepting uncomfortable racial equality The implicit idea Trump’s voters aren’t motivated genuine political disagreement race dupes voting wrong candidate they’re dumb Google tax plan Any solution begin correct diagnosis problem If Trump’s supporters fact motivated economic marginalization even full Bernie

wealth Americans regardless race gets plenty applause across political spectrum But far goal remained devilishly elusive To understand know people come wealth first place It’s popular say build wealth discipline — hitting books working hard saving money The reality little different Past Injustice Shapes Present Reality Darrick Hamilton knows personal experience Despite family’s modest means — poor hardly affluent — attended Brooklyn Friends School elite private institution teachers emphasized social justice Hamilton started college Oberlin excited seek path American Dream But soon found path smoother others All around white kids affluent families getting checks mail parents — money could spent tuition extracurricular activities kind socializing builds professional networks Black students modest means hand often disadvantage even parents able help financially If received money home things besides books demanded financial attention The true job Even black students worked hard saved diligently money often spoken time pay tuition bill semester The reason cumulative effects centuries gross economic disadvantages black families endured slavery Jim Crow beyond The legacy severe headwinds even individual family able reach middle class still likely constellation poorer extended family members need various kinds financial assistance When call help Economists call “wealth leakage” Hamilton noticed phenomenon play among black students school professional realm Rather enjoying resources parents grandparents often provide money cousins nieces uncles siblings After obtaining PhD economics UNCChapel Hill Hamilton teaches economics urban policy The New School New York focused poverty family increases racial wealth gap middle class black individuals The source wealth building America realized less save capacity invest asset money given parents grandparents These transfers critical acquisition assets like home small business — kinds things require huge payments “If you’re fortunate enough get payment resource key juncture life” observes Hamilton “you pathway towards building economic security somebody else You could jerk You could good person It little particular individual” This logic flies face longcherished belief education hard work great equalizers American society Many still insist much present day inequality caused bad individual decisions structural problems associated discrimination But vast inequality black white citizens suggests there’s going poor choices In according Federal Reserve’s Survey Consumer Finances median household wealth whites compared paltry black Americans The reason says Hamilton pretty clear “In capitalist system lack capital locks inequality” Fortunately thinks problem alleviated willing aim attack source Hamilton colleague William A Darity Jr Duke University stratification economists pioneers emerging subfield social science focus structural dimensions person’s economic position They propose solution wealth inequality may appeal across political spectrum Why give every American baby seed capital grow take part capitalist system This could done argue “Baby Bonds” would set every child born How Baby Bonds Work Baby Bonds Hamilton’s formulation would funded directly Treasury held account federal government similar Social Security The amount child receives would depend wealth position born If she’s offspring Oprah Winfrey Bill Gates might get upwards born lowest rungs economic ladder The average amount child would around Accounts would guaranteed nominal one half rate return payout would take place child becomes adult At time get spend money — anything The funds would used “clearly defined asset enhancing activity” like financing debtfree education purchasing business buying home The program would need coupled financial reform regulation mitigate predatory effects including extraordinary tuition increases aimed exploiting betterresourced young adult baby bond recipients A commission would set identify exactly kinds activities might qualify “These conditions set protect resource” says Hamilton “In situation I received infusion cash young adult would lot family needs take care I could begin thinking selfinvestment like purchasing home Specifying money spent may guarantee outcome people still choose investment engage least ensures investment assetenhancing endeavor help build wealth long run” Unlike past proposals child savings accounts Baby Bonds designed doesn’t matter parents contribute Hamilton says done however good bad affluent poor parents may citizen get seed capital take part American economic mobility system But wouldn’t program costly Not says Hamilton He notes million children born every year average account whole program might cost billion If add another billion highest estimate administering program comes billion maximum That might sound like lot consider federal government already spends trying promote asset ownership tax code He cites report policies like mortgage interest reduction reductions capital gains CFED Washingtonbased nonprofit focused expanding economic opportunities lowtomoderate income Americans All told programs cost billion dollars The mortgage interest deduction alone estimated cost billion tax years Next figures Baby Bonds looks like bargain They also advantage distributing capital it’s needed Federal programs already place tend funnel money towards affluent says Hamilton noting bottom percent earners get percent billion top percent get well half He thinks Baby Bonds could fully funded simply capping existing mortgage interest reductions So would raceblind program help close gaps wealth income black white Americans Hamilton points percent black households fall national median wealth distribution means test Baby Bonds program well target needs keenly focused wealth Baby Bonds address wealth two ways First way black people clustered poorer end wealth distribution qualify program Secondly program focused assetenhancing activities benefit become adults able use funds build kinds assets often reach historically A Potential Political Winner Inequality hot topic political season much discussion focused student debt Hamilton acknowledges important it’s enough close racial wealth gap “It help avoid wealth leakage millions people black individuals end going college” says “It’s certainly case black students disproportionately impacted student debt But helps actually end going college It’s limited approach” Something needed He notes countries programs similar Baby Bonds already implemented child trust program set gave every British citizen born September investment account build savings would help fund transition adult life The UK program differed Baby Bonds several key ways smaller scale parents could add account trust unconditional meaning money could used anything rather specific set potentially wealthbuilding activities Unfortunately program sank wave austerity following global recession it’s unclear exactly well worked children received accounts yet old enough used Could Baby Bonds work America Hamilton observes past conservatives liberals endorsed programs designed give American children stake future KidSave program conceived thenSenators Bob Kerrey Nebraska thenSenator Joe Lieberman Connecticut cosponsor would allotted child small deposit birth around additional deposits every year five years The money would invested limited number mutual funds couldn’t withdrawn retirement substantial nest egg would theoretically grown Various versions plan attracted support conservatives like Senator Rick Santorum Pennsylvania Heritage Foundation The premise behind Baby Bonds slightly different it’s based recognition problem building wealth savings “Most Americans don’t save period” says Hamilton “It’s really getting access asset that’s going appreciate Homes give Americans wealth homes asset So moving us bit narrative leverage poor people better things giving incentives saying well don’t empower account actually make decisions lead mobility” Hamilton observes Baby Bonds simply arm everybody opportunity benefit markets— idea diehard free market champion might appreciate “If conservatives really believe fairness markets” says “then let’s give everybody opportunity participate We’re talking

acceptable helped China You couldn’t anticipate It surprising hear Obama normally restrained discusses Iran nuclear deal refer however cautiously moment arc history might curve It one several interesting moments intimate minute meeting Obama held journalists Roosevelt Room White House Wednesday What follows description conversation reveals president sees nuclear deal larger problems Middle East well opposition deal subject returned frequently times visceral frustration seemed verge disgust But Obamas primary message one certainty That meeting record — gatherings routine event White House normally record — spoke easy manner eagerness discuss finegrained details deal well criticisms Of foreign policy issues Ive addressed since Ive president said Ive never certain sound policy right thing United States right thing allies Since world powers reached agreement limiting Irans nuclear program three weeks earlier Vienna Obama calibrated remarks deal narrow political mission Get enough support get past Congress That meant emphasizing ways deal serve US Israeli security interests limit Irans nuclear program downplaying everything else To hear draw connection nuclear deal

behavior nuclear issues rather means enforcing He careful times premise deal Irans good intentions much less country undergoing sort transformation Still unguarded moment seemed suggest hope deal could help create possibility change Several times Obama asked — resisted answering — simple question What plan deal falls apart Congress example could block deal something looked possible Friday Democratic Sen Chuck Schumer announced would oppose Yet Obama eager talk killing deal would bad ways would allow Irans nuclear program proceed set back US foreign policy refused say would happened At one point one journalists present began asking plan B Obama cut joking wanted save journalist wasting question Politically understandable hed refuse answer says Plan B would look foolish says good plan B would make easier Republicans justify killing deal Yet important question The closest got providing answer challenged whether alternative deal really war hes frequently asserted He describe clear plan B rule number options I say military option inevitable provocative win argument Those dictates cold hard logic said If Congress killed deal doubling unilateral sanctions Iran would enough said get another deal And quite certain would possible force P partners world powers party nuclear deal countries like India South Korea even Japan go along Congresss demand set new higher bar nuclear deal accomplish If happens said we’ve sort run options point At minimum we’ve done we’ve put Iran driver’s seat In one scenario said Iran could pull deal resume nuclear development immediately The scenario everybody talks happening years happens six nine months In another scenario Iran would declare intention abide deal Sanctions would fall away Russia China would exploit opening hijack process

economic projections circulating fantastical But argues none really matters The presidents role define priorities must later translated wellcrafted policy details says In democratic polity wonks help Waldman point If elected president Sanders could certainly get top economists tighten policies He would vast machinery federal government available sweat details The best experts academia would

debating details campaign proposals level fantasy football wonks Events intercede bureaucracies weigh Congress balk promises broken Remember Barack Obama ran president opposing individual mandate flipflopped supported one So whats point paying attention As someone pays quite lot attention campaign policy processes heres answer Watching candidate run campaigns policy processes one best ways predicting would run White House The key word way run Some important decisions president makes run processes translate vision policy Those decisions include hire advisers listen ideas make sense strategies likely work The presidency one damn decision like another Obama famously exhausted decision fatigue job wears color suit every day one less thing decide morning This one way campaigns give us insight presidencies Presidential candidates also decide hire advisers listen ideas truly good ones strategies likely work To make decisions well need sound philosophy yes also need want hear good advice need want advisers tell theyre wrong need good instincts something want believe true simply isnt need realistic strategies likely work ones arent My worry Sanders watching campaign isnt interested learning weak points ideas hasnt surrounded people police limits wish true best evidence says true doesnt seek counterarguments instincts hes attracted strategies align hopes American politics rather know American politics And tendencies persist turn good values bad policies inspiring candidate bad president The reason I care puppiesandrainbows promises singlepayer proposal I think

Sanders sense say results dont pass smell test The reason Im frustrated Sanderss promise political revolution overcome opposition plans I think believes Im sure real plan B political revolution doesnt happen The reason Sanderss persistently superficial answers foreign policy matter theyre test ability learn fly topics hes terribly interested In democratic polity wonks help But underscores importance electing someone good hiring managing A President Sanders could hire excellent technocrats help make policy would want A President Sanders could surround experts know shortcomings ideas would listen A President Sanders could become deeply engaged foreign policy would decide Management isnt sexiest inspiring topics But Jimmy Carter tell matters A good vision destroyed bad strategy
